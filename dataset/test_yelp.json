I ordered two eggs over easy with bacon, hash browns and toast. It was really good and the staff was super friendly and attentive. I gotta say, the coffee is garbage. I'm sorry, but there's just no other way to put it. It had such a bad aftertaste, it almost felt like it was coating my tongue. Also, they butter the toast, which I don't really like, but if I go back I'll be sure to ask for the toast unbuttered.\n\nNow for the complaints. First of all, I walked in and the place smelled like wet dog. I have no idea why, but it did. The restaurant doesn't feel overly clean and the shelves holding the knick knacks were noticeably dusty. The worst was probably the fact that I had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom. This normally wouldn't be a HUGE deal, but it's tight quarters and walking through a kitchen with hot griddles and grills and stoves and ovens all going at once made me a bit nervous that I was going to bump into something. Also, I just don't like the idea of customers being able to tromp through where my food is being prepared. I guess I'm just weird like that.\n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch, so you can get poboys and burgers here. It's a pretty typical diner type of place.\n\nI probably won't go back.

There were apples on sale (I bought one) from Chile and Argentina. And yogurt (I bought three) from Washington state. It would be nice to have more Tennesse or at least Southeastern options.\n\nPS - I've been eating my way through some of the groceries I bought at TTUF and have to say that Glories Sweet Potato Chips (http://www.goodhealthnaturalfoods.com/ghnf_prod/ghnf_prod_glories.html), Tennessee Real Milk (http://tripplecreek.com/tennrlmilk/), Raspberry Ginger Peace Cereal (http://www.peacecereal.com/products) and Ginger People Ginger Beer (http://www.gingerpeople.com/ginger-beverages/ginger-beer.html) are all fantastic. How can you not like a product that features an anthropomorphic ginger root riding a TIGER?! :)   Also, TTUF is the only place I've found Ciao Bella Prickly Pear sorbet, which sounds weird, but is actually amazingly refreshing when you're trying to ward off heat stroke on 114-degree heat index days.",

We had hoped for some raw oysters but the only ones available were the $15.99/dozen ones that were a bit too rich for my blood...OK, I can be rather cheap.

Our waitress also brought some toasted bread slices to slather on more fish spread.  \n\nAs soon as we were through with the spread, our lobster rolls arrived.  At first, they looked a bit smallish but awesome, nonetheless.  The plate came with crisp potato chips and your choice of either slaw or potato salad and we got the potato salad.  The roll was piled with goodly sized portions of lobster and two complete pieces of claw meat.  It also had a small swipe of mayonnaise on the roll as well as a lettuce leaf on a nicely toasted square bun.  The taste of the lobster was delicate, texture firm and visually ideal.  I would have asked for a lemon wedge to squeeze on it but all in all,  it was tasty. \n\nPlease check the on-line menu before you go because you could have a bit of 'sticker shock' from the prices.

They have a small selection of entree-sized \"signature\" salads that are chock full of fresh veggies, meat and cheese toppings and dressed with a unique dressing. The freshness of the salads is what I like - it never seems as if the lettuce has been sitting around drying out and wilting from having been prepped at 5:00 am that same day. Plus, they use mixed greens here, not shredded iceberg - which I despise in a salad, it should be reserved for sandwich topping only!\n\nI like the Thai Chicken and Southwestern salads. Be forewarned, though, don't get the salad and soup deal - the salad will be a notched-down version of the entree and while not bad, doesn't have as much of the good stuff on it. If you're hungry and dining with somebody else, simply go for the full-sized salad and share a soup. The creamy tomato basil bisque is tangy and slightly spicy and usually hits the spot.\n\nAnother fave here and good choice for vegging out is the white pizza grinder (sub), basically cheese and artichoke hearts - simple but yummy. The veggie grinder is also pretty good and it has a greater variety of veggies on it than you'll find at some other sub shops....like zucchini and mushrooms, for example.",

Their food has also had those same swings - both good and bad, but overall, it is certainly okay. If you are not in a time crunch, and you're in the area, it might be worth a trip.\n\nMy most recent trip, I visited with a party of six.  Right from the start, we asked for bread, since they heat it up fresh. We didn't actually get that bread and olive oil to dip in until we had our lunch. I had the blackened grouper sandwich with rice and black beans for my meal.  It was fine, although overall not much flavor, even though the fish was blackened, served on a fresh bun, with a generous portion of rice and beans. \n\nAnother member of my party had a salad with tuna, and I would not order that for myself. Bagged iceberg lettuce, with a few pieces of seared tuna on it, and saturated in dressing. I will say that the tuna looked fresh; one of my past experiences, which lead to me not eating here for years, was being served gray, yes gray, tuna!  ICK!\n\nService was friendly but slow, even though we had an experienced waitress. Food also took a while to come out.  Rounded up because the food was better than my previous visit, but it still has a way to go.",

Such was the case when I helped an elderly relative (who had just become a widower) find a mover to relocate household belongings from a condo in Phoenix to his main home in St. Louis. \n\nMy first goal was to help relieve stress by locating a mover with a positive track record and discuss the situation. I called Dircks Moving and Logistics, a Mayflower agent in Phoenix. Within two minutes the folks at Dirks put my mind at ease as they talked about their service and how they also wanted to help relieve stress at a tough time in life. I remember the owner saying with passion, \"We will take care of him!\" \n\nThey gave us a bid for the move that we thought was very reasonable and awarded them the job. While I was not in Phoenix during pack and load day, I can tell you that I was involved on the receiving end for unpacking. I opened box after box of various items and everything was in perfect shape. I specifically recall opening boxes containing artwork and ceramic items and hoping for the best. It was ALL perfect. (Whew!) This moment gave new meaning to me about professional packing. \n\nWhile we were unpacking my relative told me a story about pack and load day and how he tried to help by moving a few things around but started to loose his breath during a hot Phoenix day...i'm not sure who spotted him first but someone on the crew noticed and quickly got him to sit down, gave him water and told him they will take care of everything and to please relax. I then heard the owner's voice in my head saying, \"We will take care of him\". I don't think he envisioned this scenario but truly taking care of people must be in their DNA. \n\nThank you Mayflower...thank you Dircks for making a very tough time in life a little bit better for our family!",

Then, provide an analysis based on writing styles.  \n\n Text1: I was saving Mood Cafe for my 200th review because I went here a few weeks ago and I just loved the Crazy Chaat!  \n\nCrazy chaat is similar to other chaat, with fresh ingredients, but it has lots of different flavoured crispy bits -- so much fun!  I can't attest to its authenticity -- I have no idea about that, since I've only ever had chaat at 2 places in Philly -- but I can attest to its deliciousness.  The crisps in the chaat are the perfect textures, popping and crunching, while flavours mix and meld in the different sauces and toppings.  I don't know how to describe it all -- it's too crazy!  Top marks in taste and texture.\n\nCardamom lassi is also refreshing and yummy.\n\nThe owner, Hasan, is very friendly & helpful, and happy to explain if you have any questions.  Looking forward to going back. \n\n Text2: Walking down Chestnut street, this place is easy to pass by so- just don't. Go on in (if there's a place to sit) and find a cute upholstered chair or spot on an old leather chair, or snag a spot on a vintage velvet seat next to the window.  Share a couch or sit at the bar and enjoy all that Tippling has to offer. \n\nOverall, I like and enjoy this place, like the decor, like the drinks and like the bartenders. However, the cocktail list can get a bit pricey.  Two drinks for $34.00? What did we order? The menu is quite fancy and there are a lot of offerings.  I only threw back one egg white whiskey sour (which was delightful) so I need to be sure to come back to check out the rest of the spirits. \n\nService took a bit of time, which was odd, since when I was here it wasn't crowded. \n\nThe speakeasy feel is a bit overthrown by the open windows, well lit space and open floor plan but this isn't the 1920's/1930's- prohibition era has ended at last!  Comfortable and perfect for a smaller group.  \n\nOverall, decent place but nothing that left a lasting impression on me",

From the brusque greeting we got upon entering the restaurant, to the twenty minutes it took to cash out the check before we could leave, we spent our entire time in Zagol feeling totally unwelcome.  When we were seated, there were only a few other people there, but several groups came in after us and many of them were getting their food orders taken before we had even seen the waitress.  It got so bad that when she went to help the table next to us, they spoke up and told her, \"That other table has been here a lot longer than us.\"  Thanks, other people!  If you hadn't been so kind, we might still be sitting there!  Ordering our drinks turned into a long list of what they were out of that night.  Even so, we should have each ordered multiple drinks because once we got our food, she disappeared again, leaving us to eat a pile of spicy food WITH NO WATER REFILLS!  To highlight all of this, the dining room was too cold.  Most of the people in the restaurant left their coats on at the table.  Bad form, Zagol.  I know heating that big space must be pricey, but that's one of the costs of doing business.  Pump up the thermostat a bit.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the service, we probably would have really enjoyed our meal.  We tried the Key Wat, Beg Tibs, and Mesir Wat.  Everything we ate was delicious, and the flavors quite different from anything else available in town.  We enjoyed eating with the Injera, although about halfway through the meal it became a bit too much, and I just wanted to finish off the remainder of the food with a fork.  We would have asked for utensils at that point if we had someone to ask.  Daughter was particularly fond of eating with her hands: a warning to other parents, though--if your kid isn't into spicy food, they probably will be very unhappy here.\n\nOverall, we probably won't be back, which is unfortunate, since Zagol has a tasty offering, and Reno is really lacking for diversity in ethnic foods.

Vegetables, a plenty, even enough to satisfy me. The only thing that could've made it any better would have been brown rice instead of white, there was no choice and a warm plate that the rice came on. The hot pot itself was still bubbling as it was put on the table and I really appreciated that. It was in a heavy ceramic dish that stayed hot throughout the meal. I would definitely come back here to try a different selection.\n\nToday, seven months after my original review, I tried San Francisco kitchen again. It is still good, possibly great! This time I was there again in the late afternoon and they were much more busy than they were the last time I was there. Today I tried one of their lunch specials which is a hot dish paired with either white rice or fried rice and it includes a couple of the daily soup. Today's soup was hot and sour and it was full of goodies, Bean sprouts, tofu and something crunchy that I did not recognize. The soup was served so hot that I set it aside and begin immediately on my main dish and rice. I had mixed vegetables with shrimp and there was a good mixture of vegetables including fresh carrots and fresh Broccoli. The fried rice was somewhat mundane and I am still waiting for them to add brown rice to their menu. I had the Thai iced tea but I will try not to order that again as I felt like if it was not a caned mix it was too similar to some that I have had in the past.

That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be \"that guy\" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.\n\nI got the \"Village Burger\" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.\n\nThe duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.\n\nThe whiskey list is HUGE. \n\nIt's so small inside they don't have \"sections\" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? \n\n I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger.",

You order at the register and then sit at a table where someone will bring you food.  They focus on quality farm ingredients made when you order so expect a bit of a wait after you order.  The portions are very large and the ingredients definitely a cut above. Expect to pay $8-10 for entree type items like huge hamburgers, loaded roast beef and nice salads with fruit, etc.  Known for their shakes and custard, like ice cream, these items are popular as well.  They are very crowded so expect to wait, but that's OK as it will take you quite a while to read all of the menu options and choose.  :-)    The drive through is an alternate option but still runs a slower than other fast food chains.

A similarly large portion of nice ripe red tomatoes with lots of fresh tasting mozzarella and a drizzle of a thick balsamic glaze. Yum. The onion straws seemed completely unnecessary other than as a garnish.\n\nAs for the carrot cake, are you kidding me? The piece that arrived was enough for four adult males. It must have weighed six pounds. I took the rest to go and it still lasted two days.\n\nGreat service, great food, lovely atmosphere.

I am glad to have tried the pho at Pho Hoa, but I don't think that I'll bother to make a return trip. \n\n Text2: This place made me swear off restaurant week. Usually my husband and I avoid busy restaurants on Fridays and Saturdays and opt for a Thursday date night, we have also sworn off Valentine's Day and any other amateur hour/prix fixe/everyone is out type of night. We were still clinging to restaurant week, but have been let down on so many occasions.  Bummer. \n\nWe started off with drinks, and there is something off about the drinks here. I can't place it, but they just taste awful, and we had three different drinks. The worst was the blood orange martini. It tasted so flat and bland and almost watered down. The Pepino, the jalapeño/cucumber/basil beverage should have been packed with flavor, but fell flat with just heat and little actual taste. It was the best of the three. I then tried the cherry grand marnier drink, can't remember the name as recommended by the manager--again it fell flat and though it had been described to me as \"sweet\" it was not at all. I could taste the alcohol hardcore, but little else. I suspect they are using low quality tequilas and charging top shelf prices, but that's just my theory. \n\nWe placed our order-- guac that we customized, cheese empanadas, mexican flatbread, two vegetable sopas and the churros and chocolate tres leches cake for dessert. Our guac arrived and again, I only tasted the heat of the habanero that we had requested. We also asked for spanish onions, roasted garlic and tomatoes. I have made better guacamole whilst drunk. BLAND city. I even squeezed a lime in it form my drink to brighten the flavor, nothing. It was also way too smooth, like they had a vat of pureed avocado in the back and were just adding things in quickly. The chips also needed more salt. \n\nNext, we received our entrees instead of our apps. When the guy (not our waiter) put them down in front of us we were all \"nope, didn't get apps yet\" and he was all ok, bye and left the entrees there. Uh what? The manager did come over and apologize and offer us a free drink for the mistake, encourage us to eat meal in reverse. We did, and it kind of ruined the whole night since we filled up like crazy on the heavy entree. We then waited quite some time for our apps. The empanadas were the only amazing part of the meal. The flatbread had an odd mouthfeel to it, was greasy and again lacked flavor. We waited awhile again for our desserts and our waiter was mostly MIA for the entire meal.  Finally dessert. The churros were not fully cooked. The oil was obviously too hot because they outsides were crispy and brown, but they were pure uncooked batter inside. Gross. This was confirmed by the table next to us, as theirs were also partially raw. The cake was yummy. Subpar meal, bad drinks, kind of crappy service. I did appreciate the effort from the manager, but he has some work to do. Wish I'd tried this place before it changed hands.",

Highly recommend if you're in the Hermitage area and sick of the local pizza chains. \n\n Text2: I have been to Ru San's several times over the last 6 years, so my star rating is based on my overall experiences. \n\nTHE PROS: Very big menu with a lot of variety. I usually always order the Crunchy Mui Bueno, Tuna Tempura, and Sea Bass Yakitori. I love the sauce that comes w/ the tempura, and the Sea Bass Yakitori is sooooo delicious it melts in your mouth! I LOVE techno music so the music that is always blaring is super fine with me! The fried ice cream is also to die for! Whatever you do, DON\"T forget to order the plum sake! It is served warm and it gives you the best warm, fuzzy feeling ever! (if you drink enough! lol) It's usually pretty lively in there which is also fine with me because I prefer to ALWAYS feel like I'm at a party. \n\nTHE CONS: Although the food is USUALLY good, I have experienced times where the sea bass yakitori is TINY and the rolls are so huge you can't eat them in one bite. And for anyone who eats sushi rolls you know having to bite into one pretty much makes it fall apart. I've never had anything that actually TASTED bad, though. I have experienced waiters at times who take forever, forget you, and leave your food on the counter 10 min before they bring it to you. A few years back they always used to sing and make  a lot of noise (literrally) for your birthday. 5 years ago they even gave me a $25 giftcard for my birthday when I celebrated there. A couple years ago I made a reservation a few days in advance for my birthday because we were going to have about 10 people in our group. When we got there they had no recollection of the reservation and it still took 20 or so minutes to even get a table. :(  Last couple of years it doesn't seem like they do much for birthdays.  \n\nOverall I think Ru San's is a fun place with good sushi and a cool atmosphere. Perfect start to a night of fun!!",

It works in a pinch if you're in the mood for pork! \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered combos, both including pulled pork and spare ribs. While the ribs were smoked and tasty, they were a little tough compared to what we're normally used to. My boyfriend happened to like the pulled pork, but I felt that I could've made better at home. It was bland and seemed like it didn't have any seasoning at all. \n\nThe sides don't offer too much to chose from. There is a variety of \"dressing-\" covered starches, like potato and macaroni salads, but the only worthwhile side we tried was the cornbread pudding. I highly recommend it if you find yourself here. It's more of a bread than pudding and is at a sweetness level that can be enjoyed as a side instead of dessert. \n\nNow for the most important part, the sauces! One was a vinegar based spicy concoction that we mostly stayed away from and there was another \"mango\" flavored one that barely tasted like the fruit. The best is their sweet sauce, which is thick and similar to Sweet Baby Rays but with a little extra kick. It was great! \n\nThe service, location and pretty much everything else was pretty good, but unfortunately, we felt the BBQ could've been better and that there could've been more side selections like french fries or mac'n'cheese.",

I had made the decision in January that a New Year's resolution would be to correct my teeth. It is one that I actually went through with. I had no health insurance at the time, so all the funds would be out of pocket. The dentist I had been to on a couple of occasions gave Dr. Scaffidi as a recommendation. An initial consult and payment plan that I agreed to was done, and I had my braces put on at this location. I am glad I did. I had an early afternoon appointment, checked in and had a seat. There were several other people getting braces put on. I was the last one called back. A gal at the front desk asked if I was the mother of X, to which I said no. She then went through the other kids getting braces asking if I was the mother. I said no to all. She then asked what I was doing there, and I said I was getting the braces, then she brought me up to sign the payment plan and take care of the finances. I asked why she thought I was a parent and she gave me a blank look not responding.\n\nDespite that initial issue, I am glad I came to Dr. Scaffidi to get my braces put on. I mainly went to their location in Lakeview, only coming here for a small handful of visits. The installing of the braces was quick, and the doctor even called me himself that night asking how I was doing. That was a great personal touch. Everything was neat and clean in the office, and despite the initial issue, everything was perfect. I would recommend to anyone for orthodontistry. My teeth are totally beautiful. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 stars is because of that initial impression.",

They told my friend that the salad dressings have bacon grease in them and that they rub the potatoes down with bacon grease. Um, that is....yeah.

Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\n\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \n\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \n\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.",

Hot honey.  There should be no other choices on the menu.  A perfect blend of tang and heat, offset by the initial sweetness of the honey.  It's perfect.  They should bottle it and go nationwide.\n\n#2.  Order more than you can eat.  Take it  home.  It's just as good the next day and since it'll take at least 2 days for the smell of smoke and BBQ to come off your fingers, you're going to be craving it the next day regardless.\n\n#3.  Don't forget the lesser loved items.  The drumsticks are out of this world!  Order the half or full feast so you get a chance to try a little bit of everything.\n\nIt's been a few years since I had moved away and was struggling with finding good BBQ in the city.  Each place seemed to have something close to ideal, but never got it perfect.  Finally, just to introduce a new friend to it, I made the trek out to the burbs to show her how ribs are done right.\n\nThe baby-back ribs are the size of spare ribs at most places.  Where you'd need to order a full rack at TGIFridays to get enough meat for a meal, here, 2-3 ribs is all any normal person can consume.  Juicy and tender with a perfect rendering of marbled fat throughout.\n\nThe spare ribs are huge.  The ends are great for people who steer clear of those great fat pockets at the end, while the middle pieces are nirvana and leave juices dripping down your chin.  Seriously, how do they get them to stay so moist while crispy and slightly charred on the outside!\n\nYou ribs come out on a slice of texas toast, use it to soak up the little fallen pieces and dripping sauce (and don't even thing about wasting that sauce by using a napkin on your fingers, just grab another piece of toast!).\n\nThe sides are better than average, but really, why waste your stomach space.  I've had and enjoyed potato salad, macaroni salad, coleslaw, applesauce, beans, sausage stuffing.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend is the corn on the cob as it's a little soggy, but then again I have never found corn on the cob at a restaurant I would recommend so no strike against them there.  \n\nFor atmosphere, it's a safe \"biker/dive\" bar.  Lots of crap on the walls from over the years (when's the last time you saw a ceramic Spud's McKenzie statue in a bar!), and the staff is more than a little rough around the edges.  3/4 of the crowd are local's from a 10 block radius, but there's a certain charm to the place and everyone is friendly and welcoming.  We were there on a Thursday and were quickly recruited for their beer-pong tournament (there's an actual sanctioning body for this!), and were accepted by the locals immediately...I've been to neighborhood bars around the world and this stands up with the best of them.  \n\nThink of this as a cozy neighborhood bar that knows that have world-class ribs and are proud to share them with the occasional foodie-tourist.  It's probably a safe bet after 10 years, but I still hope they don't catch on too much, I'd hate to come back and find a hostess, reservations or even cloth napkins here.

This was our third attempt to get into the Khmer Kitchen. The first two times, even on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00 PM, there was over a 90 minute wait for a table. Ah, the power of yelp and the word getting out! Finally on this occasion, around 5:30 on a Sunday we walked in and at long last an open table. The place filled up pretty quickly and there was soon a waiting list. The list swelled to 14 by the time we left!\n\nI would really want to give the Khmer Kitchen 3.5 stars but again I wish yelp had the 1/2 star feature. Why only 3 or 3.5 stars? This is kind of complicated. First, the staff at the Khmer Kitchen is polite and genuine. They explained that Khmer Kitchen is a true family run restaurant which is nice. However  organization is lacking.  For example, when we were seated it was about 10 minutes before we got a menu, and this was only after we asked for the menus from the table next to us to us when they were done ordering. Then we were informed all of the grilled meatballs and sticks were sold out. This was at 5:30 PM on a Saturday. Finally, they have a 2 cap table that they will not use to seat anyone. On two occasions, they told us, and several other patrons that the table is dangerous and can't be used. Why not get a new table, fix it or remove it? The place is small and only holds about 15-20 people, they could use  that extra table. It is just frustrating.\n\nOnce we ordered, and we ordered 4 dishes, the first three dishes came out very smoothly, actually perfectly, one almost precisely after we finished the last. The first dish was a beef stew that was on the special menu. It was excellent and tender. The waiter said it was slow cooked all day. It came with carrots and was very filling. The next dish we had was chicken in a pumpkin and ginger broth. This was also very good, Then we had the vegetable stir fry in curry which had a lot of flavor. We ordered one other dish, a grilled steak with cucumber and a spicy sauce. This was really good too and had a nice grilled flavor. The problem with this dish was we waited more then 30 minutes for the steak after our third dish was finished. We didn't have anywhere to go so it was fine. But we did feel bad for the several other patrons waiting patiently for their tables.\n\nThe food was very good and the prices were great. For 4 people our check was $46.00 and we over ordered by at least one dish. A party of four could easily eat happily here for under $10.00 each! The Khmer Kitchen is cash only too.\n\nWe would go back to the Khmer Kitchen but I would try to get even earlier when they are not so swamped so we could try the meatballs and grilled sticks. If they had all the menu items and the organization improved I would give Khmer Kitchen 4 stars easily. Parking was also pretty easy on the street which was a pleasant surprise.",

When I go out to a restaurant in the city, I expect something of a dress code, unless I know I'm going to a dive bar or hipster foodie place.  But to go to the top of the 2 Liberty building, where this has been described as one of the most romantic views of the city, you don't expect to see t-shirts, baggy jeans and running/basketball shoes.  I thought maybe there was a special party or group there taking over the place for the night, but the staff assured me it was just a normal Saturday night.  We were having dinner with out of town friends, who wanted a fine dining experience in the \"big city\" (they're from Scranton\"), and had heard from one of their friends about the view here.  I was a little uncomfortable as the clientele had a certain attitude and there were more than a few foursome+ of young males sitting around the bar just staring at the diners.  My guests were visibly uncomfortable, she kept her purse on her lap for most of dinner.  These are all trivial and little things by themselves, but add up to make a really bad dining experience.\n\nSo, enough about the ambiance, and onto the food.  Well, can't really say, after a really uncomfortable 15 minutes at the bar, we felt so out of place with the environment, that we rushed through the meal to leave as soon as we could.  From previous dining experiences here (admittedly, the last time I ate here was over 3 years ago), I remember an awesome mac & cheese dish, a better than average steak, and a few appetizers worth coming back for.

Once for a private baking event - for that I give it 5 stars.  And then I was here for a little coffee meeting....I give that like 2.5 - 3 stars.\n\nDuring the baking event, we had a group of about 12 and we were making babkas.  I wish I remembered the chef's name because he was fun and fantastic.  We learned how to roll out the dough, a little help from the fancy rolling machine and how to knead it properly, how to load it up with filling, how to cut and fold it and then they baked them for us.  They turned out lovely and delicious.  For storage purposes, they also told us how to package them so we could keep them for Thanksgiving 4-5 days later and mine kept perfectly!  My family enjoyed it!\n\nThe event itself was fun and doing the work and baking was fun.  We even got to help with the next day's croissants - rolling them...  They laid out some nice snacks and drinks for us after the baking was done so we could chat with one another until the baking was complete.  Very nice small baking event for a very reasonable price.  That was 5 stars!\n\nOn a separate occasion I met a friend for coffee and had a breakfast sandwich.  I was happy that they could accommodate my need for non-dairy in my special drink and the croissant with egg and bacon was nice...however, I could not taste the caramel in my caramel macchiato...I went up to request more and she loaded it in there and I took a seat and again, still could not taste the caramel.  The coffee did not taste nice.  I was VERY sad about that.  My croissant was very large (update to include that this large croissant was not a negative thing!  I liked that it was large), the egg was decent and bacon was thick...but a lot of fat.  I peeled off a lot of fat from the 2 slices and left it on the side of the plate.  You're going to get fat on bacon, yes, but it was kind of a lot of fat...  And the flavor was plain.\n\nI think this place is a bit over-rated, as much as I enjoyed the baking class...but the baked goods are very good.  It's just not a great place for coffee or to eat here unless you are having one of their baked goods.",

On the weekends they serve their famous tri tip sandwiches outside for $9.25 each. They give you cups of water for free. They are big sandwiches with a generous portion of meat and self-serve toppings (BBQ sauce, a semi-spicy white sauce with coarse ground mustard and salsa). To get your sandwich you must buy a ticket inside at the bar and then get in the second line for your sandwiches. \n2. Dogs are not allowed on tri tip days because of the outdoor food. \n3. Expect a crowd. A big crowd. When we visited on a Sunday at around 1pm I would estimate that there were 50+ cars, 30+ motorcycles, and more coming all the time. It is tucked away on a windy road and you will have to park on the side of it and walk. There is a parking lot for motorcycles but not for cars.\n4. The music starts on Sundays at 1:30 p.m.\n\nMy experience was three stars because of the crowd.

On the weekends they serve their famous tri tip sandwiches outside for $9.25 each. They give you cups of water for free. They are big sandwiches with a generous portion of meat and self-serve toppings (BBQ sauce, a semi-spicy white sauce with coarse ground mustard and salsa). To get your sandwich you must buy a ticket inside at the bar and then get in the second line for your sandwiches. \n2. Dogs are not allowed on tri tip days because of the outdoor food. \n3. Expect a crowd. A big crowd. When we visited on a Sunday at around 1pm I would estimate that there were 50+ cars, 30+ motorcycles, and more coming all the time. It is tucked away on a windy road and you will have to park on the side of it and walk. There is a parking lot for motorcycles but not for cars.\n4. The music starts on Sundays at 1:30 p.m.\n\nMy experience was three stars because of the crowd. We had our dog so my boyfriend ran in to get the sandwiches, and as I sat in the car I saw three separate couples park, walk in and walk back empty-handed. I can only assume that they saw the line and decided against it. I will say the sandwich was tasty and the bread really made it. The bread is so important on the sandwich. \n\nIf you own a motorcycle, check this place out. It is motorcycle heaven. \n\n Text2: Nothing wrong with their pizzas. They overcook 'em like the chain has been doing for years. I have a problem with this particular location's management. They have never once honored a coupon that we receive in our neighborhood circulars because they are for other Domino's stores, but they don't send us any of their coupons, and they are the only store in our delivery area. So instead when you say you have a coupon for such and such deal, they start hmming and hawing about, \"Well, I don't see that we have that available.\" They then proceed to offer you a deal that is twice as expensive. Eventually they would offer something similar that they were running and maybe we would accept. Their pizzas arrived hot and burnt as usual, and since I was a regular customer, they knew where in my development my house was so they no longer needed directions. I always paid by check. \n\nNow they flat out refuse to honor any deals, only offer menu price when I call and refuse to accept my checks. I have never ever written a bad check, or even floated one for that matter. I asked for an explanation and they said that their manager was tired of making special arrangements for folks. \n\nWell, I'm sorry Mr. Manager, but I've worked for a place that has a restaurant. Special orders and arrangements is how we make money. If we refuse the special arrangements, then we are refusing business. The customer will take his business elsewhere and then write a scathing review on Yelp, which will take away more business. Now ask yourself, was the refusal to bend worth going broke?",

If you want to try something different, something a little lighter, definitely go to Mood Cafe.\n\nMood Cafe serves up a variety of chaats (snacks), which are essentially crispy flakes mixed with dates, different spices / sauces, meats (optional), beans, potatoes etc. I asked the owner for recommendations, and he recommended me the chicken salad chaat (medium spicy). You cannot go wrong with that! It's a burst of flavor in your mouth and feels healthy at the same time. I wanted to order mild (because though I like spice, I can't take the heat), but I am glad I went with his recommendation for the medium spice. It was perfect (not too spicy at all)\n\nThe lassi selection here is probably the most extensive I've seen. I ordered a mango and also tried some of my friend's honeydew.

Then, provide an analysis based on writing styles.  \n\n Text1: Welcome to the neighborhood, Pizzeria Vetri. As a Fairmount/Art Museum resident, I am happy to have you here. \n\nMy friend and I were lucky enough to snag a spot on the official opening weekend. I've heard that they don't take reservations so we really did luck out getting a seat. Our next stop was Wanderlust down at the Piazza and the fact that we were able to casually dine in our yoga gear wasn't a problem. \n\nWe both ordered the Arugula salad, although I was originally leaning towards the Italian Caesar Salad. Based on the recommendation from the couple next to us and affirmation that the Arugula salad could be prepared without olives, I was sold on the Arugula. Upon bringing out my friend's salad, they had forgotten to prepare mine without the olives. The olives seemed pretty big and unobtrusive so I said it would be okay to leave the olives. Our server was on top of it and already sent mine back. The error was handled seamlessly and with grace. The salad was delicious and I was happy it was prepared to-order after all. I never would have thought that potatoes would go well in a salad, but they worked out quite well. The pesto was more oil based- as in not clumpy as a pesto can be- and made for an excellent dressing. Although not listed on the menu, the small chunks of Parmesan cheese made for a great addition. \n\nOn to the pizza...\n\nMy friend and I had ordered one Margherita pie to split since we didn't want to fill up too much before yoga. She had originally debated on getting the Tonno pie however decided against it. This must have confused our server and we were a little confused ourselves when a Tonno pie showed up at our table. As this was an error on their end, we were able to keep the Tonno pie at no charge- score! Another issue handled with grace and professionalism. Ultimately, I did like the Tonno pizza a little better than the Margherita. I figured it would be best to start with the \"basic\" pizza and expand my repertoire from there. The Margherita was a little too simple. Don't get me wrong, simple is not a bad thing. The crust was light, flaky and baked to perfection, the basil was fresh and the cheese was melted perfectly. It just wasn't a life changing experience. The Tonno had that same great crust, but was just a little more exciting. \n\nAs many have already pointed out, the space is small and you are sitting at communal tables. Since this is a pizza joint with a casual atmosphere, I'm okay with that. Next time I'd love to sit by the window seats, complete with a view of Philadelphia skyline. \n\nThe service was fab and we even got to see Mr. Marc Vetri himself hard at work. I've never seen him before so I was quite star struck. \n\nI can't wait for my next visit. They have an awesome beer list and there are other pizzas I'm dying to try- based on the menu descriptions and seeing our \"table neighbors\" enjoying them. \n\n Text2: When Wawa discontinued their made-to-order salads, I wish Honeygrow existed. I wouldn't have had years lacking touchscreen ordering, customizable salads. Add a much larger list of ingredients, and even more fresh ingredients and Honeygrow wins hands down. \n\nThey have base salad suggestions, but you can make any changes you'd like. The touchscreen program keeps track of these changes and updates the costs so there are no $20 salad surprises at the end. You also have the option to start from scratch and put anything you want into your salad.

Then, provide an analysis based on writing styles.  \n\n Text1: Welcome to the neighborhood, Pizzeria Vetri. As a Fairmount/Art Museum resident, I am happy to have you here. \n\nMy friend and I were lucky enough to snag a spot on the official opening weekend. I've heard that they don't take reservations so we really did luck out getting a seat. Our next stop was Wanderlust down at the Piazza and the fact that we were able to casually dine in our yoga gear wasn't a problem. \n\nWe both ordered the Arugula salad, although I was originally leaning towards the Italian Caesar Salad. Based on the recommendation from the couple next to us and affirmation that the Arugula salad could be prepared without olives, I was sold on the Arugula. Upon bringing out my friend's salad, they had forgotten to prepare mine without the olives. The olives seemed pretty big and unobtrusive so I said it would be okay to leave the olives. Our server was on top of it and already sent mine back. The error was handled seamlessly and with grace. The salad was delicious and I was happy it was prepared to-order after all. I never would have thought that potatoes would go well in a salad, but they worked out quite well. The pesto was more oil based- as in not clumpy as a pesto can be- and made for an excellent dressing. Although not listed on the menu, the small chunks of Parmesan cheese made for a great addition. \n\nOn to the pizza...\n\nMy friend and I had ordered one Margherita pie to split since we didn't want to fill up too much before yoga. She had originally debated on getting the Tonno pie however decided against it. This must have confused our server and we were a little confused ourselves when a Tonno pie showed up at our table. As this was an error on their end, we were able to keep the Tonno pie at no charge- score! Another issue handled with grace and professionalism. Ultimately, I did like the Tonno pizza a little better than the Margherita. I figured it would be best to start with the \"basic\" pizza and expand my repertoire from there. The Margherita was a little too simple. Don't get me wrong, simple is not a bad thing. The crust was light, flaky and baked to perfection, the basil was fresh and the cheese was melted perfectly. It just wasn't a life changing experience. The Tonno had that same great crust, but was just a little more exciting. \n\nAs many have already pointed out, the space is small and you are sitting at communal tables. Since this is a pizza joint with a casual atmosphere, I'm okay with that. Next time I'd love to sit by the window seats, complete with a view of Philadelphia skyline. \n\nThe service was fab and we even got to see Mr. Marc Vetri himself hard at work. I've never seen him before so I was quite star struck. \n\nI can't wait for my next visit. They have an awesome beer list and there are other pizzas I'm dying to try- based on the menu descriptions and seeing our \"table neighbors\" enjoying them. \n\n Text2: The shops at Liberty place is a bit of calm in the storm of honking cars and peddling people on the streets of Philadelphia. While they don't have many stores, the ones they have are diverse and well maintained. In fact, I would argue that if you aren't super picky you could do all of your holiday shopping under this one small roof. \n\nAdditionally, there is a food court which is super diverse. Everything from Indian to Salads, and Sushi to Smoothies. During the main lunch hours it is PACKED as everyone from the corporate offices in the building empty out in the food court, but during the rest of the day it is ever so quiet.",

We sat in the front window ledge area, they have tables in back as well as a few seats outside in the back (too hot these days in the summer when it is 95+) and at least one table outside in the front typically.\n\nStaff could not have been nicer, but at the same time not being in your business the whole time. My tea was just OK, but the wacky sounding hawaiian coffee with hazelnut was very good, better than it sounds.\n\nWe had the dill scrambled eggs with feta, which was OK but not great. Good quality, just not to our particular liking/taste. Also had the combo meal I think called the lot or something (scrambled eggs, bacon, french toast, etc.). Eggs were good but the bacon was incredible, probably the best I've had for breakfast in the city; not too crispy, the right amount of fat, etc.\n\nPrices were pretty reasonable, the other patrons were pretty friendly, overall a nice time for breakfast without some crazy wait like you might get at some of the other brunch/breakfast places that have a rep in the city.\n\nIf you haven't been, give it a try, it is pretty good and the people are pretty nice all around.",

Isn't the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? I don't know why I keep expecting to have a good experience at a Night Market. \n\nIn theory this sounds like a cool event. Well, apparently by the size of the crowd I'm not the only one that thinks this. I mean Night Market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people. \n\nI didn't have much time to dedicate to South Street Night Market. My group probably got to South Street around 7:30 and had to leave for another event by 9/9:30. Rather than waiting in a beer line, we beelined to the state store. What a saving grace! We were able to buy \"juice boxes\" of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street. \n\nEarlier in the day, I had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 20-25 places I would like to try. I had hoped to hit at least 2-3 places. Wishful thinking! I know I was being picky about my selections and expectations... I wanted to try a vendor that I've never had before and I didn't want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that I can visit any old day. We started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th, I knew I had to make a quick decision if I wanted to eat before leaving. Ka'Chi was in the right place at the right time. Luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at Night Market waiting in that line. I was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worse...it also could have been better. I'll review Ka'Chi separately but in short the food was good and I'm glad I waited BUT it really wasn't worth the wait.  Philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an \"off\" day. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat at one vendor and not make a dent on my ambitious list. \n\nI think I'll be passing on the next Night Market in China Town... unless the allure sucks me back in.",

Came on a Sunday afternoon with my wife and another couple. Server came to take our order and acted annoyed that I didn't realize my burger came with a choice of various side items. It was my first time there, I'm sorry to annoy you with my business! Anyway, drinks came out and we waited, and waited, and waited for our appetizer and lunch entrees. After 35-40 minutes, server comes to us and apologizes for the wait, saying the kitchen is backed up. Ok, no problem. Thank goodness for good company with our friends. Finally, after 45 minutes, we get our appetizer-a deep fried mixture of jalapeños and okra. It was seriously good and came with an incredible ranch/sour cream dip. Definitely the best part of the trip. \n\nFast forward to over an hour after placing the order and we finally get our meals. I had the Nash Vegas, a burger said to have pimento cheese amongst other things. That's what sold me, but what I got was a burger with four tiny little dollops of pimento cheese, no bigger than a dime. Ugh, not what I expected. Once we got the check, I was seriously annoyed that the server had charged us 25 cents for a small serving of the ranch/sour cream dip my wife had asked for for her fries.

After a few visits and about a dozen beers under my belt, this brewery has what it takes to standout and succeed.\n\nMost recently I had the \"Interrobang\" and the \"Peaches and Crime.\"  If you like hoppy double IPAs, Interrobang is fantastic. It can totally play the game with some of those rare DIPAs bad boys that like to float around Philly. On the other hand, the Peaches and Crime was light and refreshing. Not as peachy as the title would allude to, but very complex. Bottom line is that their beers have the complexity needed to differentiate themselves in a growing craft beer world. \n\nAnd guess what?

I wouldn't have had years lacking touchscreen ordering, customizable salads. Add a much larger list of ingredients, and even more fresh ingredients and Honeygrow wins hands down. \n\nThey have base salad suggestions, but you can make any changes you'd like. The touchscreen program keeps track of these changes and updates the costs so there are no $20 salad surprises at the end. You also have the option to start from scratch and put anything you want into your salad. There are so many different veggies, meats, cheeses, lettuce options and crunches I found that to be extremely overwhelming. \n\nI recently went with the Son of Peach, their summer seasonal salad. It came with spinach, arugula, roasted corn, peaches, pickled peppers, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella. I swapped goat cheese for mozzarella, red onions for the cherry tomatoes and added baked falafel. That was my perfect salad combo. Everything was super fresh and I thought the portion was decent. I could have eaten more, but the portion ended up being satisfying.\n\nI also enjoy their community wellness involvement. The Center City location has a monthly run club and the City Ave location recently partnered with the City Ave District's first boot camp. \n\nEven the base salads are a little on the pricey side. I think that's the only thing keeping me from being a Honeygrow regular. It's good to know where I should go when I'm looking for a healthy, salad splurge.",

FG's one patty $3.69 w/cheese $4.29, Jake's one patty is $2.99 w/cheese $3.29.

In addition, just want to note that I love Maru Global's red lanterns with the cute octopus fella on em... My house needs some of those too, because I can't stop hanging decorations from my ceiling. I can not stop.\n\nA really nice couple run this very tiny shop of wonderful authentic Japanese bites. I'll be back and back and back. \n\n Text2: Ok ok ok, I get it now. For so long I've heard and read great reviews about Lithe. I swear I've been following the website and blog for months now trying to figure out what it was all about. The answer? Take the immersion or the 101 class. Only then will you understand what you're getting yourself into. \n\nAfter finally taking the plunge and taking a 101 class, I was thrilled with what I experienced and ready to jump into my first class. Since then, I've taken a split class and skinny jeans and wow! Both were so different but both were incredible workouts. I swear muscles I never knew I had are getting some action finally from these classes. \n\nWhat I really love is the variety. The classes can be cardio focused, strength training focused, or some wacky combination of both. Classes have elements of cheer, ballet, pilates, yoga, and sometimes everything in one. It's keeps every class really interesting, exciting and challenging. I can already see a difference in the way my clothes fit and this is only after three classes. Lauren Boggi, you're a genius!\n\nMy only complaint will likely go away once I'm a veteran and that is it's very hard to tell from the descriptions of the classes what I'm getting myself into exactly. I think once I have a few classes under my belt, I'll be able to get a better feeling.\n\nOf course the classes are expensive but they're worth it. The nolibs location is small but so intimate and convenient for me since I live in the neighborhood. The good news is that if they don't have a class I want to take, I can head over to the Old City location as the credits can be used at any location. All in all, I'm thrilled to welcome Lithe into my life!",

Next we shared the duck salad- I was less than excited, because I didn't think I liked duck, but I was wrong. It was really good and was confit-prepared. I had the whole, smoked trout and the fish was enormous; I couldn't finish it all. It was served with a maple-flavored farro...cut with something I can't recall that made it sweet and sour. It was a nice compliment to the smokey fish. Hubs had the filet with blue cheese sauce. Delicious, but a rather small cut for $40...and the only reason this isn't a 5-star review. We skipped dessert and coffee out of sheer fullness. All in all, a really nice place to spend our 24th anniversary.",

Arrived right in the rush without a reservation, but they seated us at a bar high-top with zero wait. The physical space is open and impressive. The ambiance is very hip, and we saw a number of people taking pictures of the brewing vats and tanks. I have zero issue with the industrial style but it isn't as warm as their original location. Some people might take issue with that, we are fine with it. \n\nThe beers are tremendous - the two Tired Hands staples (Saison Hands & Hop Hands) and then seven to nine exclusive to this space. 4 oz, 8 oz & 16 oz pours, samples to try before you order, excellent explanations. The staff knows their stuff and the beers came quickly - plus as soon as we were getting close to draining a glass they were there to see if we needed anything else. Didn't have a bad beer the entire time. \n\nWe LOVE the food selections at the original, and the menu here is purposefully a little different. There are several appetizer selections, several taco choices and a few large plate selections. Also a few desserts. We had the house made chips, salsa roja and guacamole. Great starter. Guac was delicious and had a nice spice kick thanks to jalapeños. Salsa was sweet and was a great compliment. Chips were great, and when we ran out of chips but still had extra dips they quickly brought us another basket of chips for $.50 - well worth it. Excellent way to begin the meal. \n\nMy wife had the lamb tacos and I had the shrimp tacos. Both were delicious. The fig and fennel marmalade on the lamb tacos really brought out the flavors - they were great. I loved the shrimp tacos - they were outstanding. They make their own hot sauce, which was awesome although I over poured on my second taco and basically burned my face off. 1000% my fault, and when our server saw I was sweating she quickly brought over a complimentary 4 oz of Hop Hands, explaining it would wipe out my palate and erase the heat. She was right - really saved me. We split dessert - the \"donuts & coffee\". A homemade donut and beignet with house made chocolate-coffee dipping sauce. It was fine but would have been better served with a good scoop of vanilla ice cream. Interested to try a different dessert next time, as well as probably check out the fried chicken. A table near us had it and it was an impressive looking meal. Next time for sure.\n\nNot sure I agree with or understand the complaining about the price - appetizer, two orders of tacos, dessert, a whole bunch of great brews, a nice tip - no complaints from us. I think reservations are pretty necessary on a Friday or Saturday evening since they are rightfully the hot new spot. No highchairs or booster seats, same as their other location. But for a new spot on the Main Line, it was really, really impressive. Another great beer-centric reason to head to Ardmore. Great job - looking forward to returning!",

I'm truly amazed at how many people commented on the state of the bathrooms.  I was expecting to go there and see outhouses based on the reviews here.  Since I typically don't go to a movie theater with the lone reason of peeing, I didn't really care and bought my tickets on fandango.\n\nIn typical \"me\" fashion, the second I got there I had to pee.  After reading the reviews I was truly frightened.  I even wore closed toed shoes in anticipation of a literal crap hole.  Imagine my surprise when I walked in to find shiny, almost glowingly clean stalls.  The only smell was that of cleaning supplies.  I didn't even see a single square of toilet paper on the floor.  I went again after the movie - same thing.  Forget all the reviews that said otherwise - the bathrooms here are fine.  Perhaps management has read the reviews themselves and made a change.\n\nThe theater itself is pretty standard.  We saw it in Digital Projection - I couldn't tell a difference from Standard, but I only go to the movies 2 or 3 times a year so perhaps I'm not the best judge.  The quality and sound were great though.\n\nThe only thing that irked me about this place is how big it is.  I realize that is a selling point for some people but just like I don't go to a movie theater to pee, I also don't go to watch 24 movies - I go to watch one.  In my opinion, the size here is a negative because it only creates crowds and long lines.\n\nOverall, pretty standard - I don't see any reason to not go back.",

Typically the food is good and arrives (delivery) within 40-60 minutes max.  This is fine.  Two weeks ago our experience was to this level, though the fries seemed to be bottom of the frier (literally) as we received mainly \"bits\" of fries, most of which were hard and only shells.  We also attribute this to being Friday night, as our other orders were during the week.  Today (Monday), I got home from work and my g/f and I were rather hungry.  Instead of running to the grocery store and cooking, we decided to order from Slices.  This was at 7:40pm.  It's now 9:20pm and we're both still hungry.  I had to call them and they could not tell me if our food has left, but said it would be \"20 minutes\" 'til we receive the food.  This is quite ridiculous as their estimate on delivery time was only 50 minutes when we placed the order.\n\nThe food arrived at 9:25pm.  It was not exactly as ordered, but tasted decent.  Still, this was far too long to wait. \n\n Text2: My girlfriend and I visited Heirloom last night.  With this being a relatively new BYO, we figured we had to check it out.  We arrived slightly early for our reservation.  We were told we could be seated immediately outside, so we decided to go that route.  Inside it sounded very loud.  Outside was a nice volume, even with the occasional SEPTA bus driving by.  Since we were only inside for a moment, I really didn't notice the decor.\n\nOur waiter, Mark, was incredibly nice.  He said he was newer, but his knowledge of the menu was excellent, including specials.  He was very personable, but not overwhelming.  His recommendations with the menu were spot on.\n\nFor appetizers we enjoyed the Carolina Crab & Shrimp Chop Salad.  The salad was great.  My girlfriend was happy with it.  I went with the Crab Cake over Sweet Shrimp Gumbo.  The flavor was great, especially the shrimp.  Will definitely have it again when we go back!\n\nEntrees were a bit difference.  My girlfriend chose the Red Snapper special.  The fennel head ferns were amazing, but the snapper was not seasoned.  With no salt on the table, this made for some bland fish.  I chose the Road Berkshire Pork Tenderloin.  The meat was great!  I enjoyed it, though it could have used some salt or seasoning as well.  The Kale was decent, and the glaze & gravy were good.\n\nDessert was an Apple Pie Doughnut.  The taste was incredible.  The doughnut and ice cream together were spectacular, as were the other elements of this dish.  The texture was great as the doughnut was nicely crisped versus doughy.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our experience & really loved all the staff which whom we interacted.  The reason for the 4 star rating is purely due to the lack of seasoning on the fish, and lack of salt & pepper on the table.  We will be back, even if we have to sneak in some salt!  The wait staff really helped push our rating from a 3 to a 4.",

We found out from discussions with locals that the local kids weren't on spring break, but this place was still pretty packed with people on a Thursday afternoon.   Some o the attractions, in particular the dinosaurs, are on display permanently, while others are rotating.  We enjoyed all of it, really.  I noticed many of the displays seemed more aligned to boys (Hot Wheels, Superheroes, geckos, race cars, archaeology and construction).  When we left, we asked her how much she liked it and she gave it a thumbs-sideways, meaning it was okay.  We spent three hours here and she was ready to go.\n\nMom and Dad still enjoyed it, though, so I guess 3  1/2 stars for girls, 4 for Moms and Dads, 5 for boys.",

Leading Edge Physiotherapy is a great clinic. Location is down the hill from downtown, so you can walk (if it's not your legs or back that's injured, that is) from Grandin LRT station. This place is right in the Royal Glenora Club, and is more or less what you would expect of a sports clinic. Staff is really great, and I always feel welcome and well taken care of. I'm seeing Kristin weekly for Intramuscular Stimulation, and now there's no one else I'd trust to stick needles into my spine! I'm using IMS to treat chronic muscle soreness/tightness in my back that massage therapy and yoga haven't been able to resolve. So far, the results have been amazing and I'm really pleased. My cousin is currently in graduate school to become a Physical Therapist and completed her practicum as well as worked part time at both Leading Edge locations (the other one being in St. Albert) and had nothing but good things to say.

Instead of a place taking a sandwich and cutting it in half, it feels like this place just put 2 sandwiches and placed them next to each other to resemble it cut in half.  It was good.

For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi.",

Something with the cream, it's light and fluffy! And not too sweet at all!\n\nSalted Caramel Cupcake: recommend by staff. It was really good but way too super sweet. One bite and I was done, the icing is just way too rich for my tasting. \n\nBacon Chocolate Chip Cookie: another recommendation by staff. I tasted bacon once throughout the entire cookie.

The girl was right! She told me it was buttery and not dry at all. I hate dry scones. But OMG!!! Out of the world yummy! If I didn't have the lavender scone I'm sure my rating would of been a 3 star.

However their outdoor seating on the sidewalk is lacking. Some plants, and colorful decor would make it a lot more enticing. We ordered the Tostadas and salsa which was good, but could have been spicier and split the fajitas which were good but not great. Definitely order extra tortillas if you're sharing, because three is not enough! \n\nOur server was very quick and attentive, but I did feel a bit rushed. They could benefit from a little PR. Comfy outdoor seating, Bring Your Own Tequila margarita bar, guacamole made at your table side, etc. They don't have a ton of competition in the area, but there was a lot to be desired at the end of our meal! \n\n Text2: Where do I begin? I moved to Palm Harbor 17 months ago. I dreamed I would be able to find a non-corporate, personable cafe and coffee shop to come to in the morning, meet friends, have a great cuppa, and contemplate the scent of the beautiful gulf breeze. I found that and a lot more at Old Town!\n\nThe coffee is from Baby's Coffee with roasting locations in Key West, Florida and Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, The bread is from Giovanni's Bakery in Largo, Fl. Desserts and pies come from J.J. Gandy's (famous for their Key Lime pies) right here in Palm Harbor.\n\nThe breakfast items include, bagels croissants, paninis,  all available as sandwiches. I've almost tried them all as I will never turn away an offered bite from friends!  Belgian Waffles, a breakfast Cuban, Panini, or Burrito? No worries. Breakfast is available all day!\n\nBut the choice of sandwiches, salads, soups, and wraps go on and on for great cafe lunches. I can't do it justice. I can say that as I'm doing this review, I'm inspired by the amazing Chicken Salad sandwich (w chopped grapes), with fresh lettuce and tomatoes on whole wheat! \n\nThere was recently a turnover in ownership. This has not affected the great service and friendliness as a familiar staff member/customer took the reins. In fact, they are constantly asking their customers, local and new, for ideas. \n\nYes, many mornings on the front deck, my friends and I are enjoying the menu, sharing random thoughts, and loving the coastal life at Old Town Cafe.

That's right, I'm talking about sugaring. TMI goes out the window after giving birth ;)\n\nI received a gift card to Sweet Momma while I was pregnant. While they offer a variety of spa services specifically geared towards pregnant women (I'm told the massage is heavenly), I opted to get my lady bits sugared since I had reached the stage where I couldn't groom myself anymore.\n\nI've never had anyone do any kind of, um, personal grooming on me before, so I asked the esthetician to walk me through every step. She was very thorough in explaining to me exactly how sugaring worked (apparently it is less painful than waxing because it doesn't take off any skin cells), what she would be doing (also asking me exactly how much hair removal I wanted), what I needed to do to prepare myself, and also how everything is sterilized and kept clean from one client to the next.\n\nI felt very at ease during my treatment and the pain was totally manageable (to be fair, I do have a high tolerance for pain). The esthetician did a great job and I was nice and smooth for a week before regrowth started coming in.

After reading so many amazing reviews, I was pumped to try this little eatery in the farmer's market.  Off the bat, I was unimpressed with the young woman at the counter who acted like she got stoned before work and forgot where she was.  It took her about 8 minutes to get together our order, which included two of the same type of pre-wrapped sandwiches and bottled drinks out of the display case, and two small sides.  When she forgot to add our drinks to the order and we reminded her, so slowly responded \"Uhhh... oh yeah... right... sorry...\" with a spacey look on her face.  My girlfriend and I just looked at each other like \"wtf?\"  The inferior service didn't faze me immediately because I figured the brilliant food would make up for it.  \n\nI had the turkey and sun-dried tomato sandwich and chickpea salad with local feta.  The chickpea salad could have been great, but it far too salty due the large amount of capers included.  On to the sandwich... what to say?  It just wasn't good.  I was expecting fresh, flavorful ingredients that would blow away my taste buds.  Instead I got what tasted like a two-day-old sandwich with dry, bland turkey and gross bread.  The bread was sourdough, but was *really* sour, with dense, doughy texture; it crumbled in my hands every time I picked it up.  I finally gave up and just pushed the bread aside and salvaged the turkey and vegetables.  My girlfriend and I just kept exclaiming how disappointed we were and couldn't understand the 5 star reviews.\n\nI normally like to give second-rate places another chance, but I can't see myself going back here.  I feel like people lose their shit over am@fm because it's so trendy to have ~local~ ingredients (like, OMG!) and because it's owned by a celebrity chef.

Mind you, this place is a bit fancier than where I would normally go, but last night was a special occasion (anniversary dinner for the man and I) so we made reservations for 2 and decided to venture out for a swanky evening.\n\nWhen we arrived, the host was friendly, efficient and brought us to our table right away. The server promptly greeted us after, but we needed a few moments to browse the wine list so we asked him to return shortly. When he came back, we ordered a glass of commodore wine and a malbec red wine as well as the tuna poke appetizer. As we settled in, I noticed the environment in the restaurant had a great feel to it. The live jazz band that was playing added a nice touch, that was one of the reasons we chose this place to begin with.\n\nThe app and wine were delivered to us quickly. We both enjoyed our wine and the appetizer was tasty as well. I'm not one to eat raw tuna often, but it was well seasoned and had a good consistency, so that was a winner. Next we split the watercress & arugula salad, which was brought out to us on 2 small plates (Bonus points when a restaurant does that without me having to ask them to split it). That was really tasty as well, had a great mix of flavors.\n\nFor our entrees, he chose the chicken marsala and I ordered the sea scallops with polenta and asparagus. The server gave him a choice of spaghetti or a vegetable side with the marsala and he went for the spaghetti. When our meals came out, I was a bit surprised to see that my meal only came with 3 small scallops on a scoop of polenta and some overcooked asparagus. I'm not normally one to eat all of my meal when I go out, I almost always have leftovers, but this was such a small portion I ate it all up even with the apps and salad that we had first. Mind you, the scallops were very tasty, but for $25 I would expect a bigger portion. Sadly, he said his chicken marsala was a poor quality; it had no taste, the spaghetti was a big gloppy hunk of noodles and to top it off they even charged extra for the spaghetti. Who charges extra for noodles at an italian restaurant when they are traditionally included with the dish anyway?\n\nAs a final touch, the server knew we were celebrating a special occasion, so they brought us out a slice of tiramisu to share, which was indeed delicious. Some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. This helped to redeem the poor chicken marsala experience a bit. \n\nOverall, the service was good, the food was tasty for the most part and the ambience was upscale yet relaxing, so those were all good points. Based on the few negative points with the small portion size of my meal and the poor quality of his, we have arrived a total score of 3 stars for Timpano's. I've heard great things about their weekend brunch and mimosas, so may consider returning for that sometime.",

It's quieter and more laid back. Plus, parking is much easier! You just pull in right in front.. Or if you'd really like, you can go thru the drive-thru!\n\nThis location is large and clean. A friend told me that this location used to be a bank. They converted it over really nice. The outside is really cool looking. You have the option of eating inside or outside.\n\nThe staff were friendly and eager to take our order. The beignets were excellent. I hadn't had any in 4 years. I really enjoyed them this time though. Their coffee prices tend to be on the higher side. I guess they are so famous that they can charge more and get away with it.",

Prices went up a bit too. Gonna have to bump this rating down a notch. \n\n Text2: I really wanted to like this place, but the food just didn't cut it (and for these prices?!). A very kind employee held the door open for us as we entered, but we were left standing at the host's desk for a bit before someone showed us to a table outside. I noticed immediately that there were crumbs on my plate and napkin. Odd. We were told Sarah would be our waitress, and we did speak to her once before our waiter suddenly changed without warning. I didn't catch his name.\n\nWhile waiting for our orders, my bf noticed how high the armrests on the chairs were, which made them a little more uncomfortable. I marveled at the price of a milkshake ($7!) and all the other items on the menu.\n\nThe bf & I ordered the \"blazing\" wings, which were not at all blazing and actually quite bland. However, they were hot when brought out to us and had just the right level of crispiness. I thought they were on the greasy side though. These would have been really good wings if they had had any flavor.\n\nWe also got the East Loop thin crust pizza, which had a lot of pesto, chicken, mushroom, and red onions. It looked like it had a lot going on, so I was excited... and then put off by the strange texture and aftertaste of the pesto. I really wasn't expecting that. I ate the two smallest slices and was not at all tempted to eat more.\n\nSo I probably won't be back. Maybe I would have liked a different pizza or a salad instead of the wings, but eating here again would feel like a gamble. I'd rather stick to Papa John's or Domino's for pizza & wings.\n\n\nThey did play some good music though.",

Plus there's something relaxing about watching all the planes take off or wheel around the grounds while waves lap softly behind you. Thank goodness there's also a covered restroom for the families.\n\nHOW TO GET THERE\nCars can definitely get there and park in the metered spots--although since the waterfront and parking lot are less than 20 feet from each other it's very easy to not pay and just keep an eye out for the meter maids. Biking there is also great since the road coming from the north side barely attracts vehicles so you often get the whole road to yourself.

Since the guy's parents were paying for dinner, I did my best not to order anything really expensive (but it all was), so I got a steak that came with crab meat and two pieces of asparagus on top, figuring that I wouldn't order any side dishes to keep the bill smaller.

I went again after the movie - same thing.  Forget all the reviews that said otherwise - the bathrooms here are fine.  Perhaps management has read the reviews themselves and made a change.\n\nThe theater itself is pretty standard.  We saw it in Digital Projection - I couldn't tell a difference from Standard, but I only go to the movies 2 or 3 times a year so perhaps I'm not the best judge.  The quality and sound were great though.\n\nThe only thing that irked me about this place is how big it is.  I realize that is a selling point for some people but just like I don't go to a movie theater to pee, I also don't go to watch 24 movies - I go to watch one.

Jake's small fries are $1.49, large fries $1.99.\n\nFive Guy's offers free in shell peanuts to munch on while you wait for your order to be cooked, Jake's does not, but Jake's make the very best house made potato chips I have ever had, does that bear repeating, helz yeah and it is a huge portion of the very best potato chips for $1.49, not only that, they last a good week, if taken home!  \n\nJake's makes awesome milkshakes and with the coolest flavors, like chocolate strawberry, chocolate banana, orange cream, root beer, strawberry lemonade and so many more, plus they always have a flavor of the month, they also have a burger of the month. Five Guys do not offer milkshakes, boo.\n\nJake's have salads, a garden burger, a turkey burger, a BLT, grilled or fried chicken sandwiches, chicken clubs or chicken fingers, Five Guy's have none of these things. \n\nThey both make the split and grilled all beef hot dog, Jake's offers it with chili, Five Guy's has no chili in the house. Jake's have pretty good onion rings, Five Guy's have none. \n\nAs you can see there are some big differences between these two chains, both in offerings and in price, for instance Five Guy's grilled cheese is $3.19 and Jake's is $1.99. They both offer as many free toppings on the burgers, as you like.\n\nI've already decided that I will never buy chips at the market again, that's how good these homemade chips are! Fantastic thick milkshakes with too many choices of flavors, so I guess I'll have to try them all, heck I may as well just smear them on my hips!",

We decided to order some desserts (okay, definitely not a healthy choice, but it is a holiday weekend and we were working hard!) and opted for the mothers day strawberry pie.  We figured we should get 2 slices for the table, when really we all could have shared one!  It was AMAZING - seriously, you've never had strawberry pie like this before!  The crust was flaky but dense in a delicious par-baked sugar cookie kind of way - it was delish!  The strawberries were fresh and had made a nice syrup inside the pie, not too sweet, but so flavorful.  The pie was topped with fresh whipped cream which made the decadent pie even more divine.  \n\nAround noon, we started noticing that the small restuarant was filling up and decided since we had lingered and enjoyed our experience all morning that it was probably time to go and let them fill our table with other customers.

They don't live near any coast, so the chance to eat fresh seafood is a real treat for them.  It was late at night so we managed to miss any of the big crowd.\n\nNot sure why it took me so long to get back to this location as I've driven by it many times over 25 years.   We were quickly seated by the friendly wait staff, and had a chance to check out the menu.  I decided on the grilled grouper with garlic mashed potatoes and southern green beans.   Our food arrived promptly, and both the grouper and sides were cooked and seasoned well.  The grouper flavor was quite fresh, and the simple grilling really let the flavor shine through.  The kids ordered an assortment of seafood to try out, and they were very pleased with the freshness and flavors of each item.\n\nThe food was good, the beer was cold, the service was excellent.  Add in our time together in a quiet booth catching up on their lives was precious, and it all worked together for a very pleasant evening.

Then mussels in red sauce came out. Beyond small and not enough flavor. About half the mussels had meat that was a penny size. That is not acceptable. We then ordered crabs that came out drier than the Sahara dessert. Although meaty, the price of 7.50/crab was beyond crazy. The crab seemed way over cooked and then cooked again!! The manager did make it better by bringing out 2 new crabs that were better without us even asking for replacement, which was a definite plus, but they need to do something about price.

I still had a few rough cuticles and hang nails on my hands when I got home.  \n\nMy experience was pleasant - a 4 star based on only having to pay tip & tax... (and I always tip extra on a gift certificate)... but if I had been paying full price... I'd be leaning towards 2-3 stars based on price and quality for the price.\n\nTara was a lovely woman - but I'd rather pay the strip mall price for $60 for a mani/pedi and be in and out even if I don't get tea and my own quiet little room.",

On Wednesdays they have a family pack special which includes a pound of pork barbecue, a pint of a side item, and a pack of buns for $9.99. Not bad considering we can make 4 meals out of it.

The coffee did not taste nice.  I was VERY sad about that.  My croissant was very large (update to include that this large croissant was not a negative thing!

Not always cooked to order.\nThe green beans are always great, but they get so cold so fast.\nTheir salads are really good, always fresh, crisp lettuce.  I like the tangy tomato dressing since they don't have catalina or french.\nWe get take out from there instead of eating in, the parking lot is insane and the take out is just as good as table service.",

Atmosphere was intimate yet still a full house.  The actual restaurant was huge with super high ceilings.  Very nice place.\n\nI got the shrimp and grits.  They were jalapeno cheese grits and jumbo shrimp with a brown gravy.  It was amazing.  Not a huge portion though so I suggest getting appetizers or dessert too.\n\nMy lady got the squash crepes (maybe?) and she really liked it.  Bro-in-law got fish cuz he couldnt eat anymore fried foods that weekend (sissy).

That being said, I was in great company, the people working there were amazing when they finally showed up, and the food was wonderful. I got the Vegetarian Platter, which was so, so good and it's also something I'd recommend to first time Ethiopian diners.

We browsed the farmers market and found some amazing honey, salsa, meats, and more!  Then, we ended up eating in the kitchen and it was delicious!  Followed by lunch we went to the store and bought some macaroons - which was my first time to have these delicacies and they were out of this world!  Overall, we had a lovely time! \n\n Text2: Papa Vito's is definitely one of the better places in O Fallon to grab a pizza that does not come from one of the chain restaurants. When Papa Vito's first opened a couple years back I was excited to give it a try. After several positive experiences I have no qualms about recommending this place to anyone looking for some good thin crust pizza. I've had several of their pizzas, peperoni with my son, the Monster which is their all meat pizza and quiet possibly my favorite their buffalo chicken pizza. For this pizza they substitute the pizza sauce with ranch and then layer on the Romano cheese and buffalo chicken. If you like wings, then you will like this pizza. The buffalo sauce is not too spicy, but has a great flavor. \n\nI really like the hometown feel of this place, their covered patio adds a nice space as the inside is pretty small. I like the fact they have Magic Hat #9 on tap and any place I can get a Fat Tire is going to make my list. \n\nI'm not near Papa Vito's as much as I used to be so the chances I have to stop in here are limited, but anytime I have a chance I will stop on in and enjoy some great pizza.",

I have never had oxtail before, in fact I have never had any kind of tail so I was curious. I took the croquette and plopped it into the cheese dipping sauce and took a taste. Holy smokes!! I instantaneously became a fan of oxtail. It was juicy and full of flavor.

Great views from the taprooms 2 bar areas (upstairs and downstairs) and large upper and lower patios as well. I can already picture snowy days here...all they need is a fireplace (Hint, Hint). From upstairs you can look out in the brew room, and much to my surprise you can also sit in there and enjoy your pints where the magic happens! As for the beer, if you haven't tried any of them yet, though they have been available at many bars, restaurants and filling stations, it's quite tasty. My faves so far are the Basil Rye Man and the Cutaway IPA. And I hear there is a sweet potato stout on the way as well. With room for 12 taps, there is much to look forward to! Cheers!",

What really put us off was he attitude of the waitress. She was just rude. She didn't smile and it felt like it was a chore just to take our order and refill our waters. There was a table next to us that was ordering alcohol, and she was super friendly to them- asking if they needed more margaritas whenever their glasses were 1/4 full. At one point, we had to flag down a different server to help us. \nThe food was okay. The choriqueso was thick and rubbery and greasy- not at all appealing. We did not eat but maybe half of it.

We had a Groupon which the server pointed out cannot be used on a Tuesday, due to the fine print.

We were promptly seated and the waitress came within 5 minutes to take our drink order. It was then 21 minutes until she came back around to take our food order! That is a long time to wait. We ordered the choriqueso app, the el chapo taco and 5 single tacos, under their taco Tuesday special. It was then over 20 minutes before the appetizer came. A gentleman at a table behind us came in after us, ordered his food, and was almost done eating it when our appetizer even came. \nOkay, so this happens. What really put us off was he attitude of the waitress. She was just rude. She didn't smile and it felt like it was a chore just to take our order and refill our waters. There was a table next to us that was ordering alcohol, and she was super friendly to them- asking if they needed more margaritas whenever their glasses were 1/4 full. At one point, we had to flag down a different server to help us. \nThe food was okay. The choriqueso was thick and rubbery and greasy- not at all appealing. We did not eat but maybe half of it. The barbacoa and steak tacos were good as was the El Chapo. The others, not so much- especially he chicken which was totally flavorless. We had a Groupon which the server pointed out cannot be used on a Tuesday, due to the fine print. That's reasonable, but again the way in which she went about it, just her attitude and interaction, was lackluster. We paid our bill, left a tip smaller than we normally would for decent service, and left saying to one another that we didn't know if we would come back to eat. \n\n Text2: I ate here for the first time this evening with my fiancé for dinner. We enjoyed the meal and I'd like to go back again to try other items. The service was slow to start- we say for a bit before our orders were taken, but it was attentive thereafter. We hit the grilled pork spring rolls to start- they were fantastic. Grilled nicely with charred crispy edges and lots of meat. He got the grilled pork and egg roll noodle bowl, which was yummy. I got the spicy brisket pho, which was good but I had to add a lot to make it spicy. Also it lacked some of the flavors I like best in pho- star anise, beef broth, etc. It was good though and filling; lots of meat and noodles. I'm interested to try a regular pho to see if those traditional flavors are there. I'll be back!",

So on special doggie days (her birthday, the day I brought her home, the day we reunited after she got lost, etc) she gets one.\n\nI personally only get excited about the Campfire donut.

The thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be worth the wait. as I inched my way to the counter which took about 25 minutes.I finally got to the cashier. She was very friendly and explanatory about the menu. She gave me suggestions to order. So I picked what I wanted and placed my order.\n\nI ordered the Bacon cheese burger with cajun fries. They give you multiple options of what you want on your burger. The toppings I chose were grilled onions,grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The burger was fantastic! I also tried the cajun fries they were good also! Still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head. They sell hot dogs at five guys, so I might keep that as an option.Also for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. \n\nOne thing that I will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil. Also they have free peanuts available for customers. If you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably NOT for you. I just thought I would throw in that disclaimer. Another heads up is how busy this place gets. You may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied. The prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under $10. \n\nIt still boggles my mind that this place is fast food, because it is almost as good as most gourmet burger spots.

I suspect they have a fast kitchen with the amount of business they get through the week with all the business parks located in the area. The portion for the price was great. The shrimp weren't huge, but weren't small, and there were a ton of them. I loved the teriyaki sauce with the shrimp and the brown rice was perfect, not tough like some places try to serve it.

They have thin, thick, and deep dish crust. The thin is maybe the best I've had. It's a flaky, buttery crust and topped with parmesan cheese. The thick crust is also really good, but it is a lot of dough. They have a buffalo chicken pizza, which I've tried on both the thin and thick crust (definitely go with the thick for this kind). It's really, really good, but super spicy. It's topped with a ton of jalapeños and the buffalo sauce tastes more like hot sauce.\n\nI've only tried their pizza, but they actually have a pretty extensive menu with pasta, calzones, sandwiches, chicken wings, and salads.\n\nThe first time I got delivery from them they did bring me the wrong pizza - thin crust instead of thick.

Oh yeah, you can also get 1/2 priced food from the late night menu in the lounge after 10pm.  So It's another late night happy hour.  I've tried Steven Starr's same type of deal at Jones but that's like slumming it compared to Steven Cooks menu at Xochitl.\n\nMy friend and I arrived hungry and thirsty, which meant we were gonna spend money regardless of the price.  We drank a few house margaritas each after a round of beers.  The main bartender in the lounge was working like crazy because this place was packed.  There were also people drinking while waiting for a place to sit.  We sat at the bar which probably was a good bet.  Drinks taste better when you see just how generous a pour they give you with the booze. [sigh]\nAgreeing to split all the food we ordered, we started with an order of the Lamb tacos which were very delicious and a decent portion compared to the Sopes (Duck, goat cheese and chorizo on fresh masa tortillas with black beans) which tasted great but mini tapas sized and the same price.  I probably wouldnt order the Sopes again.  We ordered the  frise' salad that had duck and cinnamon smoked figs and blue cheese.  Yeah, the ingredients read as culinary porn for sure but the portion wasn't porn sized, if you know what I mean. (do I need a cheesy wink here?)\nWe were still hungry since we were two guys with empty stomachs.  Since we enjoyed the tacos so much, we tried the even better pork ribs tacos and the skirt steak sandwich.  Considering we'd already taken the edge off our appetites, these dishes were sooo good.  I'd definitely recommend sandwhiches and tacos if you're looking to fill up.  They were so savory my friend claimed there was an orgy in his mouth.\n\nService down there was outstanding for us and the food overall was very good.  Final bill was only around $64 before tip.

It's a good neighborhood bar with character.\n\nTonight I was a bit amazed by the service, or lack of it.  I arrived with a buddy for drinks and dinner, and arrived hungry.  When we sat at the bar, the bartender, one of about 5 people behind the bar working, came over and finally took our order for a drink.  We finished our drinks and wondered if they'd ask about food.  Instead someone eventually asked if we wanted another drink.  I had to suggest they take our food order which they said \"OK, you know what you want?\"  So we ordered.  \n\nThe food was great.  The drinks were great.  It was a while between times of my first drink being empty and my 2nd drink offer.  We were surrounded by staff that ignored us, essentially.  They were friendly overall, don't get me wrong, but they couldve encouraged us to stay longer.  When we finally asked for the bill, I saw that my friends cocktail was covered by happy hour, though my beer wasnt, from the first round.  Happy hour, huh, no one mentioned it even.  I feel like a good staff wouldnt ignore you and they would let you know there's a happy hour offer.\n\nIt's OK, all was OK.  Just weird when staff is aloof... when it's less than busy in a place.

A helpful Yelper (or perhaps a yelpful helper) alerted me to Cyranos.\n\nWe came in Sunday around 11:30 and the place was buzzing nicely, but not crowded. Brunch served till 3. The place had a very nice vibe.   Placed an order for a breakfast pizza and the brioche french toast, each for $8.  After waiting just a bit too long, we got our food.\n\nThe breakfast pizza was definitely very pretty (see my attached photo), with the eggs and mozzerella and sausage and bacon all looking tasty.  Ultimately it just turned out to be a bit bland.  Texture was great, with the melty cheese and crispy bacon, but the crust, while nice and thin,  was kinda cheap and boring, along with the thin layer of unremarkable tomato sauce.  The raw red onions on top of the pizza didn't really belong.  The flavor wasn't there.  I'm thinking that some spicy salsa would have really saved it.  All in all I'd give it a 3.\n\nI was hoping the french toast would deliver, but it was also a bit disappointing.  It looked good but seemed kinda dry and not flavorful.  My dining companion thought it was fine, nothing special.\n\nSo the food wasn't so impressive, but the atmosphere and overall experience was decent.  Right across the parking lot is a really nice open produce market with some killer prices on fruits n veggies.  And then Euclid Records is right around the corner.  So between these three places you can kill a few hours and have a nice afternoon.\n\nMy hunt for good breakfast pizza goes on. Next stop --  Pi in the CWE, and I'm expecting good things.  If anyone knows any other places that have good breakfast pizza, let me know. \n\n Text2: Some say it's rare in life to experience true perfection, but if you have 4 bucks in your pocket, perfection can be found at this custard stand, in the form of something called an Hawaiian Concrete.\n\nIt's a blend of custard (vanilla/chocolate/twist, I choose the twist) with pecans, coconut, banana, and pineapple, and it is just amazing.

Atmosphere was intimate yet still a full house.  The actual restaurant was huge with super high ceilings.  Very nice place.\n\nI got the shrimp and grits.  They were jalapeno cheese grits and jumbo shrimp with a brown gravy.  It was amazing.  Not a huge portion though so I suggest getting appetizers or dessert too.\n\nMy lady got the squash crepes (maybe?) and she really liked it.

So much L O V E for Arnold Myint and his amazingly random and wonderful restaurants.  This one is my favorite spots in Nashville so far for casual, no-pressure dining.  Here's my top 5 as to why:\n\n1. I got half of a turkey sandwich, a side of sesame-chili eggplant salad, freshly homemade potato chips, mint lemonade, and a perfect slice of a Mexican chocolate-coconut brownie to round off this most refreshing meal for under $10 with tax and tip.\n\n2. I love the farmer's market relaxing, open atmosphere, and I love even more that am@fm has a \"bar\" style seating available where the staff waits on you.  Such a cute, well-decorated nook!\n\n3. The options that they offer may SEEM limited upon first glance, but if you read the descriptions of each sandwich and salad, you soon realize that your options are in fact limitless.  The little refrigerator you see before you boasts such a fantastic variety of styles and flavors and sings to anyone who walks their way.  Vegan?  No problem!\n\n4. I hate going to restaurants where I immediately think: \"I could make this myself, only better.\"  That thought never crossed my mind here!  They play on very simple food items (sandwiches, salads, chips, brownies), and just pump up the volume on them by adding great flavors through savory/sweet spices, and an interesting new play on added ingredients.\n\n5.  As an added bonus, they have an AWESOME touch pad to pay for your food (if you pay by credit card).  They check all of the items you purchased, and hand it over to you to add tip and sign.  Then it e-mails you your receipt!  Love the environment-friendliness of it all!\n\nHit up this spot for the freshest, most delicious under $10 well spent!",

I usually think of a small group of friends sharing some snack and drinks.  This is the best description of Mojo Tapas, I think.  Okay, there were just two of us visiting this time, but looking around the room, there were several groups of four and the feeling was very convivial.  \n\nWe were making our second stop for the evening, having had a full dinner at stop #1.  As such, we came in thinking dessert.  Some of these menu items sounded better than dessert, though, so we tried the veal meatballs and the sweet potato and andouille hash.  Both of these dishes were delicious, if maybe a little small for the price.  We also had a couple of glasses of wine.  The list of reds by the glass is kind of short, but we both liked our choices.   For the next round, we had a sangria and an excellent cocktail I believe was called raspberry chocolate cake.  It looked like milk with a little cinnamon on top, but tasted much much better.  The sangria was not as sweet at we've usually had, but it was pretty good.   With these drinks, we got the bread pudding.  It was delicious, if a little stiff.  Service was very prompt and friendly.\n\nThere was some live music I didn't care much for - a jazzy crooner and a guy on guitar.  Meh to the music.  Otherwise, though, we really enjoyed our stop at Mojo and will probably keep it in mind for after dinner cocktails in the future, possibly for dinner.",

After repeatedly being subjected to rude service,when I would stop in for a slice of cake or a cookie, I decided to order my daughter a birthday cake thinking that maybe I would be better appreciated if I was dropping more cash.\n\nI let my daughter pick out a cake online. I went in and ordered  the cake I wanted. It had lot and lots of trendy scroll work on it. I asked If the scroll work could be done in purple. I was told yes. Of course, I was not spared the rudeness but I had gone too far to stop now. \n\nWhen I went to pick up the cake, the scroll work was minimal at best and it was a bright royal blue. I had a purple birthday party to go to and a royal blue cake!\n\nThe final sucker punch was the name on the cake was wrong. I explained that for 100 dollars the name and scroll work should be correct. I even pulled the picture up on my phone  and showed them how the scroll work did not even resemble what was on the cake. The woman agreed.\n\nI was stunned when the woman at the counter told me I WOULD pay for the cake whether I wanted it or not. \n\nNot wanting to ruin the party, or create a scene, I paid for the sad cake and took it to Rouse's and asked them if they would they write the correct name on my Gambinos cake if I bought a cake there.\n\nThankfully Rouse's understands customer service, the lady there was polite and sympathetic to my plight.\n\nIt bothers me that Gambino's appears completely unwilling to do anything to make their mistakes right.",

This particular excursion wasn't with current Yelpers per se, but were it not for Yelp, I wouldn't have the guts to even drive into the city to try the newness.\n\nThat said, I walked into Ariana with some trepidation. Having read \" The Kite Runner\" and \" 1000 splendid suns\" I had an idea of Afgani cuisine, but would I like it?\n\nI was meeting some good friends, old and new, for a pre Lost Finale meal, so the excitement was palpable. I was late and they had ordered some apps. I thought it better not to ask and just dig in as my mind somehow tortures me when given too much info. I was blown away! There was a delicious puff pastry filled with spices and cheese, and a sort of raviloi with garlic and meat sauce.  Both killed it.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered a spicy beef kabob over rice. I loved it! This along with the apps were almost remeniscant of my time in Greece, so they were very Mediterranean influenced ( or vice versa). \n\nThe kabob was little mini meatloaves on a skewer with veggies. The waitress carefully pulled out the redhot skewers,  which saved me from burning my face on them. They were HOT but not obnoxiously so. I think I should order all my food like that, as a way of slowing me down so that I can actually enjoy a meal. I loved the rice and bread that accompanied it as well.\n\nOther things on the table that I sampled, were a pumkin app and a cauliflower dish. Both impressed. We were stuffed and running late so we had to skip dessert, but it's something to look forward to for next time. \n\nJust a note that I ate my leftovers the next day without the luxury of being able to heat it up and it was also excellent cold. \n\nSo chalk another ethnic cuisine off my list. Thanks to Yelp ( and specifically Eric and Aaron) for making this too easy. Any of you that were like me, thinking the Asian chicken at Wendys is exotic, can take my word for it. It's better to give these places a shot. There is life after hamburgers.",

The prices were surprisingly inexpensive. The service was quite slow, but we weren't in a rush. We started with calamari, which was served hot, but needed some sort of spice. As for the main courses we had lasagna, eggplant parmigiana, and spaghetti and a meatball. The food was good, but I had to add a lot of crushed red pepper and salt to give it flavor.

Frankly, I would go back for the tacos and pay full price. The guacamole was chunky and had decent flavor, and the portion size was decent! We sampled all of the simple tacos, which are $2 during happy hour. There was a ton of meat (or veggies, i.e. cabbage) in each, so we separated the two tortillas and made two tacos! My favorite was the chicken, with the brisket coming in a close second. I am not a big fan of queso, but my husband is. I would have to say that it was pretty decent, and the portion of chips that came out with it was quite generous. The margaritas were quite sour. I liked them, but my husband was not a fan.

I've been wanting to go for a while, and watching an episode of Bizarre Foods is what pushed me over the edge to try some non run-of-the mill common cuisine. The experience started off good. We were promptly seated and began to look through the menu, which is HUGE (I'm talking about 18 pages!) Our waiter came over and we ordered an appetizer to start-the #10 (can't remember the name) which was a pancake like option stuffed with shrimp and other goodies-very awesome and my favorite thing ordered. We told our server we still needed a few more minutes to look through the menu. However, for whatever reason, he did not come back to take our order. When our appetizer arrived, I asked if we could place our order. When the entrees arrived, we were still working on the appetizer. Not the hugest deal but a little annoying. My pork chops were flavorful, yet were very fatty and not that big (I walked away kind of hungry). The vegetables accompanying the entrees and the appetizer tasted a little funky. Unfortunately, we weren't checked on throughout the meal, nor were any plates cleared from our table once our appetizer was gone. Overall, I was not a huge fan of this place.

However I am still a fan( just barely) This is a large farm and country store that features various pick your own options depending on the season. For the fall that means pumpkins and apples. \n\nMy biggest qualm with this place is that there is no difference in price between pick your own or those items picked up in the store. And you have to pay for a tractor ride out to the fields($4.00) Would it kill them to deduct the fee from your purchase? Anyway, we did it for the experience and it was fun, and from the children we encountered, they were enjoying it too. But at .79 a lb for pumpkins, you would save mucho dinero by purchasing them from your local supermarket( who most likely also buys them from this farm at much cheaper costs)\n\nWhile on the hayride you also have an option to pick apples. Again, same cost inside the store, and the apples on the tree are huge. Think of the  chocolate covered monsters you see at the holidays and you are getting close. \n\nThe store boasts many varieties of baked goods. From these we sampled a pumpkin blondie that was incredible. There are also sandwiches, salads, snack foods and take home dinners to name just a few. Some of these food options are also available outside on busy weekend days. You can tell that much thought has gone into maximizing commercial viability. There are other activities for children here including a petting zoo, corn maze and other farm like displays. Most of these activities carry fees also.\n\nOverall I am thrilled that this farm is thriving. Places like this can connect us to the land, and provide children with their first glimpses of where our food really comes from. But I can't help but imagine that a generation ago this operation would not be so commercialized. And I really hope that this trend does not continue to worsen. Because if it does it could exclude those who may appreciate and need it the most. 4 pumpkin spiced Yelps",

The layout is so primitive and grrr - I love it.  It is truly a great venue but is certainly a work in progress.  \n\nThis year marked our second Naughti Gras experience at Koken.  Last year - I believe it was held in a different building or different part as there were multiple rooms and levels - it was like being in a cool yet freaky and fun-filled maze.  However, it was highly congested, drink service took FOREVER, and it was very difficult to watch some of the performances such as Lola Van Ella and her troupe.  \n\nThis year - the event was held in basically two rooms - one massive room with all the artwork, bars, and main stage and one smaller area that housed the food trucks and secondary stage.  I must say it felt much more 'open' this year.  There was an amazing selection of artwork to view and with plenty of viewing space in my opinion.  There seemed to be ample bathrooms as I did not have much of a wait if any at any given point throughout the evening.\n\nThe bar service was MUCH better or at least on Saturday evening.  There was very little wait at any of the bars.  However, the main bar in the center seemed to be lacking in their liquor/mixer selections.  There was a side bar towards the second room (beer & wine only), and that bar was basically wide open most of the night (and the servers were very friendly and entertaining).  \n\nMy main beef....everything inside with exception to a few vendors and so forth was CASH only yet there were no ATMs anywhere to be found.  That was a HUGE miss - esp. if folks came in equipped with plastic vs. paper.  I have no idea if there were even any ATMs within a 4-5 block radius but sure as sh*t wasn't going to venture out in the freezing cold to find out.  Perhaps the cash only deal was noted somewhere on the event info. but next year....splurge for ATMs - make more moolah.\n\nThe rumor on the street was that parking was a disastrous nightmare - I had friends that walked for several blocks in the freezing cold.  We arrived approx. 7:30PM and parked right outside the venue...now this could've been luck, but I suggest arriving early or even on time.  Last year - we arrived maybe 9pm or so and yes....parking was an absolute nightmare.  \n\nAt any rate - I know Koken does more than Naughti Gras, but this is the one event I am guaranteed to attend every year.   We love art and being naughty so works for us. It's a great experience that I highly recommend attending.  BRING CASH! :)",

My mom is a loyal Plaza Lexus customer so I admit I shopped there first. I found one that I really liked and tried to negotiate with them. They told me there was no way they would give me the price I wanted and acted like I was some young dumb girl who could easily be played. I went to Mungenast and found the exact same model and colors with the same features. They gave it to me for the exact price I had wanted without much hassle. They also offer $50 coupons for your service appointments as a thank you for purchasing a new vehicle from them. Their service area has a luxurious feel with free snacks/drinks, upscale bathrooms and seating areas, as well as a quiet room for reading or work.

The layout is so primitive and grrr - I love it.  It is truly a great venue but is certainly a work in progress.  \n\nThis year marked our second Naughti Gras experience at Koken.  Last year - I believe it was held in a different building or different part as there were multiple rooms and levels - it was like being in a cool yet freaky and fun-filled maze.  However, it was highly congested, drink service took FOREVER, and it was very difficult to watch some of the performances such as Lola Van Ella and her troupe.  \n\nThis year - the event was held in basically two rooms - one massive room with all the artwork, bars, and main stage and one smaller area that housed the food trucks and secondary stage.  I must say it felt much more 'open' this year.  There was an amazing selection of artwork to view and with plenty of viewing space in my opinion.  There seemed to be ample bathrooms as I did not have much of a wait if any at any given point throughout the evening.\n\nThe bar service was MUCH better or at least on Saturday evening.  There was very little wait at any of the bars.  However, the main bar in the center seemed to be lacking in their liquor/mixer selections.  There was a side bar towards the second room (beer & wine only), and that bar was basically wide open most of the night (and the servers were very friendly and entertaining).  \n\nMy main beef....everything inside with exception to a few vendors and so forth was CASH only yet there were no ATMs anywhere to be found.  That was a HUGE miss - esp. if folks came in equipped with plastic vs. paper.  I have no idea if there were even any ATMs within a 4-5 block radius but sure as sh*t wasn't going to venture out in the freezing cold to find out.  Perhaps the cash only deal was noted somewhere on the event info. but next year....splurge for ATMs - make more moolah.\n\nThe rumor on the street was that parking was a disastrous nightmare - I had friends that walked for several blocks in the freezing cold.  We arrived approx. 7:30PM and parked right outside the venue...now this could've been luck, but I suggest arriving early or even on time.  Last year - we arrived maybe 9pm or so and yes....parking was an absolute nightmare.  \n\nAt any rate - I know Koken does more than Naughti Gras, but this is the one event I am guaranteed to attend every year.   We love art and being naughty so works for us. It's a great experience that I highly recommend attending.  BRING CASH! :) \n\n Text2: OK so I was trekking on my hot rod 2 wheeler (Schwinn) the other day and found myself out of steam in not the best 'hood as far as stopping on the sidewalk/street whilst alone.  I spotted this cozy corner rest area and parked it.  Good idea, Al....why - thank you!\n\nFirst - the set up is pretty rad.  Plenty of space and types of seating to cater to your butt needs.  Local artwork on the walls that you can actually purchase if you so desire.  Electrical outlets for your technology needs and in my case...battery vampire phone.  I also am going to go out on a limb and assume they have Wifi.  \n\nI needed protein and got an overdose.  They have two of my all-time favorite things on the menu - a peanut butter & banana smoothie w/soy AND bacon wrapped dates..Wha-what?  Now before I get ahead of myself - I opted out on the dates that day, but I will surely be back to give them a go in the near future.  I actually ordered the cheese quesadilla because I was looking for protein in a snack-based form.  It was quite delish, cheesy, and took care of my dietary needs.  The sauce was zingy as well - a nice additive if you choose to dip those tips. I also enjoyed a delightful iced latte with espresso (added) and caramel, which certainly recharged my energy cells.  \n\n\nThe peeps...they were so very informative and helpful.  I had a chat with a nice gal about the big biking event going down in Dutchtown in May and a brief history of past events - MoPro...look it up and enjoy.  The sweet gal that actually took my order was very helpful considering I had never dined at Urban before and had no clue what to order.  She actually hand made my super awesome PB & banana smoothie.  I felt the love.  She also informed me of their Sunday Brunch - dim sum style, which I was very intrigued by and intend to experience in the near future.  Always looking for new and exciting brunch adventures on the weekends.\n\nOverall - I really dig this place.  I intend on coming back so I can explore there other dining options AND get some of those bacon wrapped dates....and another PB & banana smoothie, of course!",

That makes sense for a place called Pancake house, but I was really hoping for more savory breakfast options.  I landed on the Corned Beef Hash and ordered poached eggs to put on top.  I must say, out of all the beef hash I've ever had, this ranks dead last.....it was awful.  The beef was diced so fine it no longer resembled corned beef.  The potatoes were way over cooked and the texture between the two together reminded me of something you'd feed a horse or pig on a farm.  BLECH.

That makes sense for a place called Pancake house, but I was really hoping for more savory breakfast options.  I landed on the Corned Beef Hash and ordered poached eggs to put on top.  I must say, out of all the beef hash I've ever had, this ranks dead last.....it was awful.  The beef was diced so fine it no longer resembled corned beef.  The potatoes were way over cooked and the texture between the two together reminded me of something you'd feed a horse or pig on a farm.  BLECH.  I cut into my poached eggs to let the yolk run out and help the dish out, but the yolk was solid.  I asked the waitress to make me new ones that are runny and as she was delivering the new ones, she dropped them to the ground.  SIGH.

The \"sandwich\" that came out was basically 2 sandwiches. Instead of a place taking a sandwich and cutting it in half, it feels like this place just put 2 sandwiches and placed them next to each other to resemble it cut in half.  It was good.  Not amazing in philly cheese steaks standards, but I was not expecting perfection from a diner.  I think it was still a solid sandwich.\n\nThe hash browns, nearly filled the whole plate (which was a massive plate) as well.  They could have been lunch on their own.

When you go in, it has a diner feel for sure.  The menu has pretty much everything you'd expect in the breakfast department and the lunch menu has classic diner fare as well as other american favorites.  I was not there during dinner but they usually have a special of the day listed up on the board for dinner according to the general manager who came over to speak with me.\n\nI ordered the philly cheese steak but substituted the fries for hash browns with onions and cheese as I am a sucker for Waffle House hash browns and wanted to compare these.\n\nFirst off...be ready for absurd portion sizes.  The \"sandwich\" that came out was basically 2 sandwiches. Instead of a place taking a sandwich and cutting it in half, it feels like this place just put 2 sandwiches and placed them next to each other to resemble it cut in half.  It was good.  Not amazing in philly cheese steaks standards, but I was not expecting perfection from a diner.  I think it was still a solid sandwich.\n\nThe hash browns, nearly filled the whole plate (which was a massive plate) as well.  They could have been lunch on their own.  While they do not take the crown away from Waffle House in my opinion, they were close.  That combined with the fact this location is close to me, makes me happy that I can come here for good hash browns.\n\nI'll definitely be back here again when I'm craving breakfast foods...or if I'm with someone else and we want to share 1 item. :) \n\n Text2: La Colombe is Philadelphia's favorite non-Starbucks roaster, and I just don't get it.\n\nThe cafe itself is sleek and cool - you see less laptops here and more newspapers, which is a nice change of pace.  Conveniently located near Rittenhouse, they are in the perfect spot for tourists and businessmen alike.\n\nThat aside, I moonlight as a barista from time to time, and I personally think the beans are nothing to write home about.  Quality has definitely gone down over the past few years, likely due to higher quantities of beans being roasted.  I find that the brewed coffee leaves a bitter, dry taste in my mouth - not unlike Starbucks.  The espresso is better, but still not as great as I would have expected.  I'd agree with a previous reviewer as to the beans being roasted way too dark.  In fact, the key to LC's success has probably been locally producing a product that's still better, but not much more, than Starbucks.\n\nI'll give them 2 stars because I will drink it (most independent cafes serve it), but there are better roasters in the Philadelphia area (Chestnut Hill Coffee, Fonseca Coffee, etc).",

Super cheap, and you get a lot of food. The sushi isn't exactly top-notch, but it's decent for the price.

It's not quite Vic's, but for South Philly (and easier parking) it will do. \n\nIt also costs $4 for a huge container of chicken teriyaki sauteed with some veggies, and a generous helping of white rice. Bear in mind that this is a takeout-type place, with 2 tables for people who can't wait till they get home to eat their to-go orders. \n\nIf you're looking for cheap and filling Japanese (not a very common combo) and you're in the area, this is a decent place to go.",

That must be the $26 burger that I didn't have (mainly because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, and I didn't want to be \"that guy\" to ask for a different cheese) because the Village Burger was good, but not exceptional.\n\nI got the \"Village Burger\" (8oz, Sesame Roll, Tomato, Boston Bibb, House Made Thousand Island) with bacon and provolone (+$3). It was huge, could hardly fit in my mouth huge, and delicious, but I don't think I can call it the best burger in all of Philadelphia.\n\nThe duck fat fries were great. They were big, crispy, and hot on the inside. I'm going to get the sly fox cheddar sauce with them next time.\n\nThe whiskey list is HUGE. \n\nIt's so small inside they don't have \"sections\" for the waitresses (or it might have been because only the bar and outside seating were busy). There's the bar that seats maybe eight people, though I didn't count (it was full), four or five booths (completely empty at 5:30pm), and a little counter that seats five or six in the back (empty as well). There's more seating outside than inside. After paying one waitress, another asked if I wanted another beer. I'm not sure if it's a plus that there's always someone checking on you, or a negative because they're unorganized? \n\n I'll come back, but my main goal will be to try the extensive whiskey list, not a burger.",

And the sake tonight was $1... that's right, $1.  Um, it tasted a few steps up from isopropyl alcohol, but it was $1. (And you don't have to order the cheap hot sake like I did.  ALL sake tonight was $1.)\n\nThe rolls and nigiri I had were good.   Thankfully they were 50% off, because I agree with other reviews that the menu does seem expensive.  They were \"specialty\" rolls I ordered, I realize, but still - $14 and $9 for a roll.   Seems like a lot. \n\nThe variety is interesting.  There are many rolls, but commonly found things like spicy tuna or just salmon are missing.  However, cream cheese and/or avocado are very prevalent on the menu.  I asked if the \"Fire\" rolls were spicy.  They are entitled \"Fire\" rolls because they actually come ON FIRE.  Yes, lit on fire.  This is a cool presentation, with the only downside being that it halfway cooks some of the raw fish!\n\nI'd go to Ninki if you're in the area.",

They stock 2 of my favorites: Turbo Dog and Purple Haze.\n\nDon't forget to order the classic New Orleans sweets....beignets.   They don't have chicory coffee; however, they did brew a mean pot of French Roast for me with Cafe du Monde beans. \n\n Text2: After someone backed into my car in a parking lot, I found the auto body shop here just by searching for options near me. I work nearby so this location was extremely convenient. \n\nThe entire process was fairly simple and straightforward - much appreciated in a stressful situation! I brought my car by for an estimate. No appointment was needed for this, and I did not have to wait to be seen.\n\nI then scheduled the date for the car to go in for repairs. They gave me an estimate of three days but called me after 2 days to say the car was ready to go! This was a pleasant surprise. The drop off and pick up process was totally easy too. Their weekday hours are 7am-5pm, but I was able to drop by car off around 6:45am to comply with my work schedule. Also appreciated! \n\nI hope to not have to return but would recommend to anyone who needs auto body repair!",

The bathrooms are in front of you all the way in the back.\n\nThe staff has always been efficient and sufficiently friendly in my visits here. The parking lot can be a little tricky since it's two rows of parking spots, and you have to back up toward each other to maneuver out. This location is in Short Hills plaza, connected to Hollywood Tans, Classic Cake Company, a Vietnamese restaurant, and a dog toy store. \n\nThey usually have bagels when I get there, which I enjoy. At the end of the night, the pastries like mallorka sweet bread are pretty stale, so I don't recommend getting anything like that late.\n\nWhat I love about this location is the patio style seating to the side of it that they provide. This is great for warm weather when meeting up with a friend.\n\nUnfortunately, the crowd that this location brings is ritzy, snobby Cherry Hill/Voorhees people. I sometimes wish I'd brought ear plugs when I come because overhearing their conversations is nearly painful. \n\nOverall, I'd say come here and get your drinks and snacks to go, unless it is a nice day - then enjoy the patio with a friend.",

I really thought this place would would be awesome, but it left a lot to be desired. Probably the worst thing about coming here is it was totally dead! It was early, but not that early, a little before midnight. It was super awkward how few people were in there. We went to the bar and ordered some drinks. I ordered one of the drinks they were having a \"sampler\" of and was supposed to be discounted. But, I guess the discounted price was still $10. I wouldn't mind the price, but my drink was horrible. I could barely finish it. Like it's rare I truly consider a cocktail to be \"bad\", but it was bad. Also, there is nowhere really to sit with a group unless you are doing bottle service. We were probably here less than a hour. I would've waited a little longer to see if the place livened up, but between the overpriced gross drinks and nowhere to sit, we all wanted to leave.",

The inside is small and the décor is a bit dated, but the menu looked fantastic and the place was lively on a Thursday night.  As soon as we walked in, it was terribly hot inside and the manager/owner (not sure) put his hand up for us to not move (while we stood awkwardly in the tiny door/entry way) and instructed us to \"wait right there\" as we almost crammed onto the first table in the middle of their dinner.  Not the best greeting but certainly not pretentious and we saw he was working amongst a bustling restaurant.  It was just enough awkwardness to make us giggle.\n\n \"OPEN THAT DOOR and LEAVE IT OPEN\" he yelled across the restaurant to us. Who us? Uh. Guess so? \"Yea use that and prop the door open\" Ummm.\nGetting less funny, getting more hungry.\n(Deep breath)\nWe're seated and instructed where and on what side to sit at our table, like children.\n(Deep breath)\nOpens wine immediately. \n\nOur meal started off with house bread- it was a bit dense but perfect for dipping.  The bread was accompanied by some fresh olive oil with ricotta cheese. This could have been a homerun with some salt and pepper or red pepper flakes on the table for some added kick- I appreciate having the option.  For appetizers, my date and I got some crazy good flavor bomb stuffed peppers that were the special app of the night. There were two - one red and one yellow- and they were filled with creamy (almost cheesy) risotto, sausage and topped with their elegantly simple sauce.  The sauce was a true taste of Rome in my opinion.  I cant stop thinking of them. \n\nFor entrees, I got the Fettuccine Bolognese which was a large portion and authentic Italian.  Bonus points because all pasta is made from scratch in house which truly adds to the quality of this place.  The pasta is creamy, delicate, and smooth which allows for the stuffings/sauces to really shine.  My pasta was cooked perfectly, and the Bolognese was simple, powerful, and hearty. I had a bite of the Ravioli di Ossobucco- which was highly recommended and I can see why.  The ravioli was stuffed with braised, pulled veal shank, and fontina cheese, sautéed in sage butter, with Osso red gravy. Holy hell this was good. \n\nTo finish- two cannoli of course. \nBomb dinner.

Jay was our waiter and was very efficient.  We started off with drinks and browsed the menu.  I'm not sure if this was a new menu or a special one for New Year's Eve but either way everything looked delicious.\n\nThe last time we came here we really didn't bring our appetites.  This time we did along with two others.  Majordomo started with a wedge salad and the rest of us decided on the Caesar salad.  The right amount of dressing so it isn't too dry and the right amount of anchovy flavoring.  Nice crisp lettuce and nice big croutons.  \n\nFor dinner two of us chose the short rib mac n cheese with the others choosing the pork steak and the ribeye dinner.  The mac n cheese was a cavatappi pasta.  It was very good and had a lot of short rib meat in it.  M and P enjoyed their steaks just as much as we enjoyed our food.\n\nWould I go back here?  Of course I would.  There were a few things on the menu I want to try. \n\n\n\nTucked inside The Chase Park Plaza, Eau Cafe is the casual sister of Eau Bistro (which is getting a facelift and I believe changing its name).  They also have a beautiful outdoor patio.  I would like to give it 3.5 stars. \n\nWe stopped in there last night after our plans fell through to go somewhere else. I'm glad we stopped in. They have a very large wrap around bar. I started with a wonderful margarita made in a rocks glass. I like to taste my tequila.  We decided to share the crab dip which was a huge portion.  It was served with pita bread and vegetables. I don't care for veggies so I ate the bread. The dip was okay but smelled very fishy to me. I've had crab dip at other places and it never smelled like that. It tasted alright so I ate some. \n\nNext we each had a bowl of tomato bisque with grilled cheese. A huge bowl of soup with two dainty slices of grilled cheese. The sandwich was great especially dipped in the soup. The bisque itself was outstanding. Just a little tang to it but not enough to destroy the flavor.  I would get this every time and Mike agreed. \n\nAll in all, Eau Cafe salvaged the night. I would definitely come back here.",

The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it's a dish that's kind of hard to screw up.

If only the service matched the scenery. We were the only table ordering food--including two very simple salads--yet it took close to an hour for our appetizer to appear and fully 90 minutes before the six-item order was complete.\n\nWe started on chicken wings from a choice of seven flavors, ordering half \"Gotti style\" and half hot ($9.49, 8 pieces). The wings were an average size and very crispy without being overcooked. The hot sauce was anything but, tasting mostly very sweet with a hint of spice. Gotti style was a rub of powdered garlic and parmesan that wasn't bad, just a bit dry.\n\nI wanted to taste the chili so I asked if they could do a cup rather than full bowl. Being bereft of cups, a bowl was filled half-way, topped with shredded cheese, onion, and a dollop of sour cream ($4.49). The mixture was basic hamburger chili with beans, but like the hot wing sauce it was sweet rather than spicy, akin to marinara. It reminded me of the chili served by a certain eponymous chain restaurant, bland and sweet. Adding insult, it was served just above room temperature.\n\nSandwiches and salads all have fighting terms for names. The Over Hand Right burger was--according to the menu--a 1/3lb patty with cheddar and American cheese, mayo, onion, lettuce, tomato, served on a tiny bun with a side of steak fries ($9.99). I was asked how I'd like it cooked--medium rare--and received it well done, much like the burgers your uncle overcooks in the backyard. Frankly, this was the smallest $10 burger I've ever seen, thrown together in a way that required reassembly before taking a bite. The handful of fries were fine.\n\nMy wife's Footwork salad involved grilled skirt steak, baby spinach, iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion, shredded cheese and crumbled blue cheese ($10.49). The meat was tender-yet-underseasoned, and there wasn't much of it. The plate was mostly a sea of iceberg with an odd grouping of spinach on the sides, and a bit of cheese and veggies. You can have any dressing you like so long as it's ranch.\n\nAfter the wait for food it was almost amusing that they choked on a D'arce Choke salad, apparently not added to the ticket even though I'd asked a couple questions of the server on that item  ($9.49). Though ordered with grilled chicken, my pile of iceberg was covered with a ton of very dry, deep-fried breast meat that was difficult to eat. Apparently they were trying to compensate for delivering it half an hour late, but giving me twice as much of a bad thing doesn't make it good.\n\nThough only found on the specials board, I'd been told I have to try the pizza ($9.99, 12\" w/3 toppings). Though easily the most successful item ordered, it was adequate if not award-winning. The 'za was topped with plenty of cheese, mushroom, black olive, and sausage, and though the crust didn't have a lot of flavor it was definitely housemade and hand-formed. It wasn't completely crispy, but the edges had nice chew. The sauce tasted much like the chili--bland and sweet--but luckily there wasn't much on the pie. Extra points for using a puree with tomato chunks instead of canned sauce. For the money I wouldn't mind another bite of that pizza, but I'll phone it in an hour ahead and take it home.",

The other night Stephanie B, my son and a couple friends came in for some pizza.  Since SLNPC serves pizza by the slice, us grown ups were able to order what we wanted instead of just peperoni.  Based on Jackie's previous reviews we decided to go with a Big Baller and The Boss.  We initially wanted to order both Chicago style but were warned that a Chicago Style Big Baller would be juicy (I'm not even sure that is the right way to describe it) because of the buffalo sauce.  So we opted to get the Big Baller New York Style, this would allow us to have some pizza while The Boss cooked.  \n\nWhen the Big Baller came out it smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to dive right in.  It was great, just the right amount of buffalo sauce to give it a distinct buffalo chicken taste.  Also on the pizza was generous amounts of bacon, blue cheese and red onions.  Everyone at the table liked it. \n\nNot too long after The Big Baller arrived The Boss came out.  This thing was piled high with yummy goodness.  It came with sausage, peperoni, ham, black olives mushrooms and onions.  This deep dish was delish!  I personally liked The Big Baller better, but that's probably because it combines two of my most favorite foods, pizza and hot wings.  \n\nMy son had a slice of peperoni and it again received two thumbs up.  This just might be our new favorite pizza joint, as you can get just about any kind of pizza you want, and if you just want a slice, you can get that too.  Our server remembered my son and I from our previous visit and remembered that he had a blue Popsicle  and brought him another after he was done with his pizza.\n\nThe pizza was great, the fact that Big B comes out and asks you how your pizza was is pretty cool too, and the final part that makes this place great.  It's not uber expensive.  We will definitely be back for some more awesome pizza.",

Can't be beat, both for quality of wash (without damage to your finish) and value for the money. \n\n Text2: Finding a new place for a tasty and affordable lunch is always fun, though there are two kinds of \"new\". There's the paint-is-still-drying new with lots of buzz, and then there's the new-to-you, unknown until you happen past it or catch a word-of-mouth tip. I've had the good fortune to enjoy and write about both sorts, but the Microsoft Cafe takes the cake for hiding in plain sight.\n\nLocated within the Microsoft Licensing office building, the cafe is open to the public and worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. There's a full-service coffee bar provided by a well-known Seattle company, a slushee machine, fountain and bottled drinks, as well as free water infused with fruits and vegetables. My wife and I usually stick to water with meals, but combinations including mango/pineapple, cucumber/peach, apple/celery, and orange/papaya really dressed up the ol' H2O.\n\nThe \"Health Bar\" sports a variety of natural and organic proteins, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains at 50 cents an ounce. Though the usual salad suspects are present under the sneeze guard, other items such as Brussels sprouts, quinoa, squash and ceviche join a wide variety of dressing and garnish options to keep things interesting. I lost track of the tasty combination my wife selected for her plate, but the price was certainly attractive ($2).\n\nWe split a small serving of the day's soup (gumbo, $2.90) and a slice of fresh-baked cornbread ($1.55). For all I know the gumbo was out of a bag, but it did have plenty of Andouille sausage and that particular file flavor and consistency. It went well with the cornbread, though the latter could have done without the thin slice of cheddar on top. After baking and cooling, it was more like a piece of plastic than cheese. It peeled off easy enough.\n\nThe flip-side of the salad bar is a selection of deli ingredients; a decent array of meats, veg, cheese, breads, and condiments for building your own sandwich. My wife skipped the assembly line when she saw a beef and cheddar wrap just waiting to be placed on a self-service panini press ($6.95). Good call on her part, as that tortilla was stuffed full of smoked roast beef, cheese, fresh greens and onion. Although a really large array of sauces and other enhancements were available, the wrap didn't need any help in the flavor department.\n\nThere are separate stations where food is cooked to order, including stir-fry, burgers, hot sandwiches, and daily specials. This day's Chef's Special was a plate of Mediterranean greatest hits, including chicken shish-kebabs, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, cucumber yogurt, hummus, and soft flatbread ($6.95). The special surprised me, being we were dining in a corporate lunchroom with low expectations. The seasonings were pretty solid, the chicken wasn't dried out, and the tabbouleh had fresh mint. The bread, hummus, and yogurt were average but played their part.\n\nThe ghanoush, though, lacked the tahini and creamier consistency of the popular Lebanese dip. It was more of a mushy vegetable stew with a lot of black olives. I've experienced something similar to this once before--prepared from an Iranian recipe--but without the abundance of olives. Still, the flavors and seasoning were good enough that I ignored the mushiness and ate most of it.\n\nHot and cold breakfast items round out the menu, and all the weekly specials are listed online. I'll admit it was a little weird walking into an office building and asking an employee, \"Which way to the Microsoft food thing,\" but the result was a decent meal at a really decent price. Plus, there's a free video game station where you can let off some steam before continuing your day.",

Can't be beat, both for quality of wash (without damage to your finish) and value for the money. \n\n Text2: Vetri was a lot of fun and I don't regret the $390 tab (per person).  I'm somewhere in between the folks who had food orgasms with every bite and folks who felt a little disappointed.  70% of everything we ate was exceptional.  What wasn't is a matter of personal taste and could easily be managed in a couple of ways.  Note that you do receive an evening's menu at the beginning of the meal--you can flag anything that doesn't sound good and more important can ask for particular dishes.  I recommend doing this.  \n\nWe asked to be surprised and this can go two ways depending on the restaurant, you can get something that's totally 'out of the box' or you might get something that many people aren't choosing on a particular night and the kitchen wants to push it out.  For our main protein, I ended up w. goat and it was way too smoky, maybe even a slight error in the execution, hard to say.  It was a but unpleasant, could have used another flavor or two to offset the smoke.  My friend had a small, very thin ribeye and thought there was so much sauce that it overwhelmed the meat.  Best practice would have been for us to send both dishes back and I'm certain the kitchen would have replaced them with something more appealing to us.  I realized this after the fact.  The pasta w. wild boar was gamey to me-but what did I expect. A boar wanders around the forest, getting in fights, snorting and eating bark--it's gonna taste gamey.  My friend traded dishes and he liked the boar.  \n\nDesserts were excellent, but a small plate of tiny cookies afterward was a head scratcher, not particularly tasty or fresh. \n\nWe chose the more expensive wine pairing and this was a highlight.  All of the wines were well matched to the food and the sommelier gives a basic history of how the wine was produced and what to expect when tasting, After the first two courses, I asked for no more white wine and they accommodated. The descriptions get a bit silly after awhile, \"This next wine is from grapes hand picked by Armenian/Swedish nuns in the South of Italy and then rolled across limestone for seventy four days, then dragged up the mountainside by children with severe overbites\" They honestly could have been making half of it up and I would not have known any better.  I circled two of the reds when we received our copies of the menu and wines at the end of the night and will order a bottle of each from a distributor--really striking and unusual. \n\nI'd like to see more vegetables on the menu which seem to disappear after the first appetizer.  This would add more texture to the dishes and some more interesting flavors.  Noticed that there's one sauce made of brown butter that showed up at least three times, maybe a bit of overkill.  While mostly absolutely delicious, and perfectly cooked, the dishes weren't particularly complex in flavor, Vetri seems slightly dated when looking at what chefs are producing these days.  The restaurant is still totally on top of its game in all respects, I just see slight room for improvement/updating w. some minor tweaks.  \n\nWith all that said, there were many, many, amazing bites that made our mouths pop.  The service is super friendly and professional.  It's surprisingly not an uptight place at all.  \n\nThree hours passed quickly and I'll gladly go back.  It's a trip to an amazing food spa w. lots of butter!",

If only the service matched the scenery. We were the only table ordering food--including two very simple salads--yet it took close to an hour for our appetizer to appear and fully 90 minutes before the six-item order was complete.\n\nWe started on chicken wings from a choice of seven flavors, ordering half \"Gotti style\" and half hot ($9.49, 8 pieces). The wings were an average size and very crispy without being overcooked. The hot sauce was anything but, tasting mostly very sweet with a hint of spice. Gotti style was a rub of powdered garlic and parmesan that wasn't bad, just a bit dry.\n\nI wanted to taste the chili so I asked if they could do a cup rather than full bowl. Being bereft of cups, a bowl was filled half-way, topped with shredded cheese, onion, and a dollop of sour cream ($4.49). The mixture was basic hamburger chili with beans, but like the hot wing sauce it was sweet rather than spicy, akin to marinara. It reminded me of the chili served by a certain eponymous chain restaurant, bland and sweet. Adding insult, it was served just above room temperature.\n\nSandwiches and salads all have fighting terms for names. The Over Hand Right burger was--according to the menu--a 1/3lb patty with cheddar and American cheese, mayo, onion, lettuce, tomato, served on a tiny bun with a side of steak fries ($9.99). I was asked how I'd like it cooked--medium rare--and received it well done, much like the burgers your uncle overcooks in the backyard. Frankly, this was the smallest $10 burger I've ever seen, thrown together in a way that required reassembly before taking a bite. The handful of fries were fine.\n\nMy wife's Footwork salad involved grilled skirt steak, baby spinach, iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion, shredded cheese and crumbled blue cheese ($10.49). The meat was tender-yet-underseasoned, and there wasn't much of it. The plate was mostly a sea of iceberg with an odd grouping of spinach on the sides, and a bit of cheese and veggies. You can have any dressing you like so long as it's ranch.\n\nAfter the wait for food it was almost amusing that they choked on a D'arce Choke salad, apparently not added to the ticket even though I'd asked a couple questions of the server on that item  ($9.49). Though ordered with grilled chicken, my pile of iceberg was covered with a ton of very dry, deep-fried breast meat that was difficult to eat. Apparently they were trying to compensate for delivering it half an hour late, but giving me twice as much of a bad thing doesn't make it good.\n\nThough only found on the specials board, I'd been told I have to try the pizza ($9.99, 12\" w/3 toppings). Though easily the most successful item ordered, it was adequate if not award-winning. The 'za was topped with plenty of cheese, mushroom, black olive, and sausage, and though the crust didn't have a lot of flavor it was definitely housemade and hand-formed. It wasn't completely crispy, but the edges had nice chew. The sauce tasted much like the chili--bland and sweet--but luckily there wasn't much on the pie. Extra points for using a puree with tomato chunks instead of canned sauce. For the money I wouldn't mind another bite of that pizza, but I'll phone it in an hour ahead and take it home. \n\n Text2: The owner clearly dumped a load of cash on outfitting this space. The decor is very classy and very modern. However, with no acoustic treatment to speak of, any entertainment taking place makes the place sound like a bus station. The resulting concrete echo chamber just makes drink orders more awkward. \n\nSpeaking of drinks, they're overpriced. $12 for a shot of well bourbon and a pint of Coors Light? That is one expensive Blue Collar Boilermaker. Didn't attempt bowling as the price is 2-3 times higher than anything else in town. Giant screen TV's at the end of the lanes are a huge distraction to a bowler's concentration and do nothing to enhance the experience.\n\nThe bar bites are surprisingly good. Sliders with fries were above average, and the pricing is on par with market. If they'd do something about the sound issues and make the bowling market-rate they might survive another year.",

They do have beer here but only expensive ones and some I even like but if I want an Abita Amber I want an Abita Amber!  \n\nThe bar is pretty cool with lots of fresh herbs lined up along the bar that they use in the drinks and if I was going to drink a fancy cocktail this would be a pretty cool place to do it.  The bar is a bit narrow and small and there is a larger lounge type area with cushy chairs and couches.  There were VERY few people here for a Friday during happy hour time when I was here but it seems they don't have happy hour pricing so maybe that's why.  I liked the ambiance of this place alright and if there were actually people here and if they had Abita Amber I might even frequent it but otherwise I probably won't be back here unless I get some really unusual craving for a fancy cocktail.",

Unfortunately this is one of the worst examples of brisket currently in the area.  They do have a nice selection of sauces and quite a variety of sides.  They have some creative ideas and do a lot of things here with pickles, sides, sandwiches and entrees.

I admittedly had never been to the previous iteration, nor Sweetbay, so I don't have much comparison. But I will say that I am impressed with this store and will continue to frequent it. The produce looks fantastic and is very nicely displayed on ice. The selection is pretty expansive, and they have a nice organic section. I would have preferred some additional organic produce, but I was pleased with what they have. I heard great things about their rotisserie chicken (supposedly better than their unnamed main competitor) and the pizza looks yummy. They deli counter is expansive (Dietz and Watson, not Boars Head) and they have house-prepared deli meat. They have a huge Kosher section, which is unheard of in Tampa, and lots of other ethnic food (excellent Asian selection for those of us who like to cook with those ingredients). We were greeted several times and asked if we needed help finding anything. One gentleman said to please let them know if there is anything we are ever looking for that we can't find in the store. The store is clean and bright. Can't give it 5 stars yet because I haven't tried enough to speak to actual quality, but I will definitely keep going back!",

When my work declared happy hour at this location, how could I not resist beating rush hour traffic to order my favorite craft beers?\n\nNow, I'm a fan of porters and stouts, so ML Rose never disappoints. This time, I ordered the Highland Black Mocha Stout from Asheville, NC which went down ever-so smoothly. It was quite frankly like drinking velvet. I've had the Japa Milk Chai stout in the past and was similarly thrilled. ML Rose is to beer as Nashville is to country music: it is the definitive marker of what beer goes. Period.\n\nIf you happen to be a huge fan of bar food, this location does not disappoint. I particularly appreciated the generous portion on my Carolina Sweets order. So, let me explain this magnificent paragon of culinary achievement: perfectly crunchy sweet potato waffle fries hugged by dollops of pulled pork, all smothered with a carolina mustard bbq and kissed by a few diced green onions. Talk about food that hits every tastebud high note: savory, sweet, sour, and (with a kick of hot sauce from your table) just a bit spicy. I suggest saving the entire plate for yourself because you will not be inclined to share. Trust me, this dish inspires selfishness in us all. While I have tried the Five Alarm Burger, I admit that what truly sticks out is the Caroline Sweets dish due to satisfaction alone. Bar none.\n\nBecause we did come in such a large party, I do believe the waitstaff struggled to handle the numbers. Beers were delivered late or could not be ordered due to busyness, orders were forgotten or delivered to the wrong people. Common mishaps considering the huge party that we made up. However, the quality of my food and beer were still spot on, despite my beer gazing at me from afar (for far too long). \n\nI would suggest the Charlotte location if you are looking for a less busy location, but this one is fun since it has a lovely beer garden in the back. Eat, drink, be merry at M.L. Rose. It's diner paradise for sure.",

I will admit the prices have scared me off in the past, but for our 1 year wedding anniversary, my wife and I decided to come here for dinner.\n\nOh boy.  This place quickly made my top 3 Indy restaurants.  I would love to come again to see if I had an amazing night due to a fluke or the fact it was a happy day in general, or if this place is truly magical.\n\nYou can see the pictures below of what we had (only 1 item missing, the Kung Pao Brussels which I ate too fast)\n\nThe items come as Small, Medium or Large on the menu.\n\nWe started with the home made Boule (Bread) which was fantastic and soft.  Should this come automatically with your meal instead of being $5? maybe, but I understand if they charge for it since it is very good.  The sauce that comes with it is very heavy on the garlic, we did not care for that.  That being said, we also ordered the Trillium cheese and used the bread to spread the cheese on it.  The cheese comes melted with Marcona almonds and a fig jam that was more like a mousse rather than a jam.  I highly recommend this cheese appetizer. **To the business, I recommend looking at Tulip Tree's Foxglove as well.  I think it melts better than the Trillium and has a fantastic rind in comparison to the Trillium**\n\nMy wife got 2 medium plates (The Spring Salad and the Lobster Waffle).  She said the Waffle was a bit too rich for her, but the bite I had was fantastic.  The salad she loved, but I did not care for it as I am not huge on beets and it was beet heavy.\n\nI got the Duck & Duck and this dish made my night.  If every other dish was wiped off the menu, I'd still come here.  The Duck & Duck serves you duck two ways.  A duck confit in a crepe and duck breast sliced medium rare.  The duck is cooked perfectly and has amazing flavors.  The plate decoration is also functional as the sauce globs on the plate add great depth to the bites of duck.  This is by far, my favorite duck dish I've ever had.\n\nWe split the Kung Pao Brussels (Sorry not pictured) and it was simple, but delicious.  Imagine roasted brussel sprouts tossed in a kung pao flavor sauce and topped with crushed peanuts.  Was very good!\n\nFor dessert (Hey don't judge, it was our anniversary!) we got the Ricotta cake which was two slices of cake with a ball of ice cream on the side.  Presentation was beautiful as you can tell by the picture below.  Everything was delicious here, and it was a nice simple dessert.  \n\nI plan on coming again, and truly feel embarrassed to never have been here before.",

Such auspicious beginnings. Such a sudden and disappointing finale.\n\nWe walked in to this tiny strip mall corner restaurant. About a dozen tables with white table clothes.  I was thinking that in my experience, the hole in the wall Mexican joints were always the best.  At least, that had been true in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and even SoCal. \n\n We sat and ordered the Agua de Pina (Pineapple Water), which was a first and a pleasant drink of diluted pineapple juice whipped to a froth.  Really good! I was getting more excited as I imagined we had just discovered the Fountain of Youth drink right here in Warrington.  Then the homemade Chips and Fresh Salsa came out. Heavy crunchy mild oily sensation with a mild Mexi flavor, and a Tomato, Cilantro Salsa with a sweetness equal to the chili's heat.  Loved it. \n\nEncouraged and feeling adventurous by the fun of the apps and drink, I went for the Pollo Dorado (Golden Fried Chicken), the most expensive item on the menu.  Visions of plump chicken breast with a wonderful fruity sauce danced in my head. My friends had a Burrito de Carne Asada, and a Taco con Queso.  \n\nWhat was placed before me was instead three over cooked deep fried drumsticks with an oil soaked brown coating that tasted primarily of salt.  My physical reaction to eating this was matched by the instantly deflated sense of gluttony so rudely assaulted and kicked to the curb.  I kept eating hoping for a secondary burst of flavor to save this.  It did not come. I passed around the chicken and the reaction was universal. Bad. \n\nThe Burrito de Carne Asada was large and full of bits of beef and cheese, but way too mild, and a bit too fatty.  It was left one third eaten.  The Taco con Queso presented well, but was practically tasteless.  We liberally added hot salsa to throw them life preservers, but we could not save them.  The dinner was a victim of drowning. \n\nWe will not be back.  I wish I had a different review to write about Taco Suave, but true to the Yelpers Creed, I cannot hide from the bitter taste of a disappointing meal.  \n\nOur server, Mirna, was great!",

For me, it is the many flavors of delicious custard that draw me into culvers, and that's what the 4 stars is about! \n\n Text2: I'm too old to give you five stars......   hahhhahha\nas we approached the upstairs pool area we waited for some other older folks to exit so we didn't upset the balance of youth and tres chic.\n\nand I'm not trying to be snarky, I just have a sense of humor.   however spending ten dollars a drink on a teeny drank on the roof wasn't that impressive.    this place will take a bite out of your wallet.    while I like the overall idea, I feel like I'm back home in the city I left for a reason.   yes, I'm from portland.   but this is new orleans.   while stumptown coffee is good, I have a hard time not seeing this as a form of gentrification that only those NOT from here can really savor...\n\nI did see a recent show here / female drag, and that was spectacular.   I didn't have any drinks tho, and I didn't see anyone serving any.   I didn't feel like stepping out of this venue to find the bar...  I was mesmerized by the performer.   this place is beautiful, and I can appreciate the open mindedness of freedom of expression in your hiring practices.    I haven't eaten here yet, but I will.   I look forward to seeing how you handle mardigras next year as friends of ours will be staying with you.   \n \na suite / with guitar / 30 year wedding anniversary.\n\nother than my self expression of my age, I congratulate you on your opening.  please know that setting drinks on a drum in the bar area?  is considered really bad luck.    can you find a place for the drum where she can be more appreciated?   thanks.",

While I love going there with friends to get together for whatever celebratory reason we can make up and have some delicious margaritas, I really don't enjoy the food that much. The food is really just not that good. Considering the great Mexican options we have now in the city since the Big \"K,\" I think that Superior Grill needs to make some recipe changes. They can keep the chips and salsa just the way they are, the guacamole is pretty good, but the queso could use some help, kinda tastes like they use a white version of Velveeta.  I mean I know there are some good melting Mexican cheeses out there that can help the queso situation they have going over there. Really I think the only good thing worth ordering in my opinion are the chicken or steak fajitas and sharing with someone. Now as for the beans and rice that come with the fajitas, that's where I think a recipe change needs to happen.  They have been serving those same rice and beans for as long as I can remember and boy are they boring and bland. They just don't have any flavor.  The tortillas they serve, while they may be homemade, they are just to heavy and greasy, you end up filling up on the tortilla and you still have tons meat left for the fajitas. The cheeseburgers are pretty good and huge, but they are kind of out of place at a Mexican restaurant, but my son isn't complaining about that. All the other things I have tried like the plain ole' cheese enchiladas or the tacos are nothing to rave about it all tastes so processed and fat laden, I'll go to Taqueria Corona for those. Like I said I am usually there not because I want a great meal but because I am with friends celebrating, and I think most people go for the same reason which is probably why the place does so well.

What is up with that? I'm sure it doesn't cost the owner that much for a few extra slices of cucumber. Why do Subways always smell like that?!!! Come on, you know what I'm talking about.

Then, provide an analysis based on writing styles.  \n\n Text1: Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC), the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived, it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations, something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on, the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.\n\nTo start, I had my mind set on a Caesar, a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. \n\nJoe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!\n\nThe \"Various Beets\" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!\n\nWhile I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!\n\nSauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.\n\nThe black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!\n\nI have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!\n\nOur second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.\n\nOverall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates. \n\n Text2: It's been awhile since I've been to a Thai restaurant, the last being my visit to Boualouang over a year ago. So when Jessica mentioned that we should go eat Thai at Numchok Wilai on 124 St, I was pretty excited for our dinner date! I blame Joe for his \"peanut allergy\" and my fear that even a little could kill him, even though in reality it's just a sensitivity. I'm just making excuses really... I don't know why I haven't been to a Thai restaurant in so long.\n\nI didn't dwell too much on interior this time, it was more about the company and the massive amounts of food I was about to eat. But the restaurant was pretty filled when we ate on a Thursday night. By the time we ended dinner, the restaurant had completely cleared which left me with (attached) photo.\n\nMy boss mentioned that he loved Whyte Ave's King & I spring rolls and wondered how Numchok Wilai compared. I had never been to either, so I couldn't really do so but I convinced Jessica to try it with me. I use the word \"convinced\" because I think it's rare that Asians (which the both of us are) do not order spring rolls when we go out to eat. I was raised to order things on the menu that my mother could not make better in her kitchen. Fair enough rationale, no? We ordered the pork spring rolls though just for funsies. I liked them! They were mostly filled with vegetables but hints of pork were there. Fried correctly to develop a crispy exterior without being greasy or soggy over a short time period. Wrapped loosely so that the density of the rolls were just right. Were they better than my mom's? Heck no. Did I tell my boss that? Yes, of course. But an excellent dish to order if that's what you're in the mood for and the sweet dipping sauce was a refreshing take on the traditional Vietnamese fish sauce in my household.\n\nThe benefit of dining with Jessica is that her eyes are a billion times larger than her stomach. As a second appetizer, we ordered the Som Tum Mango, a Thai style spicy mango salad with shrimp. Funny that I'm afraid of Joe dying, but not so much Jessica... who actually has a true allergy to peanuts. She's a pharmacist, she can deal! The dish did call for ground peanut, which I can only assume they replaced with cashew nuts like the mango salad, a different item on the menu. What we actually got seemed to better describe that dish, so I'm not even sure if we actually received the Som Tum Mango. The salad had a nice heat to it, cooled nicely with mint leaves and the sweetness of the mango. Shrimps were cooked perfectly making the dish a stellar choice.\n\nMuch like how every cuisine has a signature dish, the pad thai clearly comes to mind the Thai food. The rice noodles at Numchok Wilai are thinner width wise than Boualouang, which I liked preferred to the wider variety. We chose the house tamarind sauce rather than a tomato sauce, a more traditional route. Not even sure how a tomato based sauce came into play. The sauce was not overly sweet and not overly thick which I find can sometimes ruin a pad thai really quickly. Combined with egg, shrimp, chicken, beansprouts, and green onions, I loved it!\n\nThe green curry chicken came out with its own tea candle heat source, a cute presentation. Creamy, spicy (!), and loaded with bamboo shoots which covered tender chicken pieces underneath. We had ordered it moderately spicy, can't even imagine how the highest spice would fare. It's nice that they let you choose that option for all spicy dishes! Loved the mixture of coconut curry and thai basil!\n\nLastly, dessert! Four dishes later and we were still holding on. We decided to try a dish called \"Kow Neaw Sung Kaya\", a coconut black sticky rice topped with a Thai style baked custard. The custard is more of a bread pudding texture, sweet and slightly sticky. The black sticky rice was also sweetened but surprisingly the overall dish wasn't overwhelming. Perfect way to end the meal!\n\nThe meal left both of us satisfied and full! For a fraction of what a fancier meal would cost us but for the same amount of happiness. Wiiiiiin. Absolutely loved our meal at Numchok Wilai and would definitely come back. There's parking in the back of the restaurant, as well as street parking if you can find it! It made Avenue Edmonton's Best Restaurant 2014 as honorable mention in \"Best Thai\". I'd have to go to Bua Thai again to compare, as it's been over a year and a half since I've been there. With restaurants like these in town, my standard \"sushi or...\" can now be \"sushi, Thai, or...\" Where's the best Thai restaurant you've been to?",

I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. \n\nJoe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!\n\nThe \"Various Beets\" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!\n\nWhile I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!\n\nSauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.\n\nThe black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!\n\nI have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!\n\nOur second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.\n\nOverall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates.",

Then, provide an analysis based on writing styles.  \n\n Text1: It's been awhile since I've been to a Thai restaurant, the last being my visit to Boualouang over a year ago. So when Jessica mentioned that we should go eat Thai at Numchok Wilai on 124 St, I was pretty excited for our dinner date! I blame Joe for his \"peanut allergy\" and my fear that even a little could kill him, even though in reality it's just a sensitivity. I'm just making excuses really... I don't know why I haven't been to a Thai restaurant in so long.\n\nI didn't dwell too much on interior this time, it was more about the company and the massive amounts of food I was about to eat. But the restaurant was pretty filled when we ate on a Thursday night. By the time we ended dinner, the restaurant had completely cleared which left me with (attached) photo.\n\nMy boss mentioned that he loved Whyte Ave's King & I spring rolls and wondered how Numchok Wilai compared. I had never been to either, so I couldn't really do so but I convinced Jessica to try it with me. I use the word \"convinced\" because I think it's rare that Asians (which the both of us are) do not order spring rolls when we go out to eat. I was raised to order things on the menu that my mother could not make better in her kitchen. Fair enough rationale, no? We ordered the pork spring rolls though just for funsies. I liked them! They were mostly filled with vegetables but hints of pork were there. Fried correctly to develop a crispy exterior without being greasy or soggy over a short time period. Wrapped loosely so that the density of the rolls were just right. Were they better than my mom's? Heck no. Did I tell my boss that? Yes, of course. But an excellent dish to order if that's what you're in the mood for and the sweet dipping sauce was a refreshing take on the traditional Vietnamese fish sauce in my household.\n\nThe benefit of dining with Jessica is that her eyes are a billion times larger than her stomach. As a second appetizer, we ordered the Som Tum Mango, a Thai style spicy mango salad with shrimp. Funny that I'm afraid of Joe dying, but not so much Jessica... who actually has a true allergy to peanuts. She's a pharmacist, she can deal! The dish did call for ground peanut, which I can only assume they replaced with cashew nuts like the mango salad, a different item on the menu. What we actually got seemed to better describe that dish, so I'm not even sure if we actually received the Som Tum Mango. The salad had a nice heat to it, cooled nicely with mint leaves and the sweetness of the mango. Shrimps were cooked perfectly making the dish a stellar choice.\n\nMuch like how every cuisine has a signature dish, the pad thai clearly comes to mind the Thai food. The rice noodles at Numchok Wilai are thinner width wise than Boualouang, which I liked preferred to the wider variety. We chose the house tamarind sauce rather than a tomato sauce, a more traditional route. Not even sure how a tomato based sauce came into play. The sauce was not overly sweet and not overly thick which I find can sometimes ruin a pad thai really quickly. Combined with egg, shrimp, chicken, beansprouts, and green onions, I loved it!\n\nThe green curry chicken came out with its own tea candle heat source, a cute presentation. Creamy, spicy (!), and loaded with bamboo shoots which covered tender chicken pieces underneath. We had ordered it moderately spicy, can't even imagine how the highest spice would fare. It's nice that they let you choose that option for all spicy dishes! Loved the mixture of coconut curry and thai basil!\n\nLastly, dessert! Four dishes later and we were still holding on. We decided to try a dish called \"Kow Neaw Sung Kaya\", a coconut black sticky rice topped with a Thai style baked custard. The custard is more of a bread pudding texture, sweet and slightly sticky. The black sticky rice was also sweetened but surprisingly the overall dish wasn't overwhelming. Perfect way to end the meal!\n\nThe meal left both of us satisfied and full! For a fraction of what a fancier meal would cost us but for the same amount of happiness. Wiiiiiin. Absolutely loved our meal at Numchok Wilai and would definitely come back. There's parking in the back of the restaurant, as well as street parking if you can find it! It made Avenue Edmonton's Best Restaurant 2014 as honorable mention in \"Best Thai\". I'd have to go to Bua Thai again to compare, as it's been over a year and a half since I've been there. With restaurants like these in town, my standard \"sushi or...\" can now be \"sushi, Thai, or...\" Where's the best Thai restaurant you've been to? \n\n Text2: As someone who loves authentic street tacos I was pumped to see another place pop up in Indy. I decided to check the place out and the tacos did not disappoint! They come with choice of meat, onions and cilantro. My vegetarian friends were also happy as his vegetarian burrito was tasty. My only issue was they could use at least two people working the front as the person running the cash register was also taking orders and cleaning the dining room, but I'm sure that will be remedied soon. Overall definitely give them a try!",

I've been waiting to try this place out for the longest time! I came here with my wife, aunt, and uncle.

We had made reservations at 6pm for 4, thinking that the place was going to be busier, but there were plenty of empty tables when we got there.\n\nOur server was very helpful explaining each of the different sections of the menu to us. (He must've spent at least 10 minutes doing this.) Everything sounded so good it was hard to decide.\n\nHere's what I ended up trying:\n-Two cheeses (Goatsbeard farm chevre and Fayette creamery \"little darlking\") - You don't get too much cheese, but the cheese was very enjoyable. The crackers the cheeses come with are made in house and are really good just on their own.\n-Bacon fat fried cornbread - Definitely could taste the honey and lots of thyme.\n-Roasted brussels - This was my favorite of the night. The malt vinegar aioli was amazing with the brussels.\n-Roasted cauliflower - Came out with the roasted brussels, and I think I only had one bite because I was so mesmerized by the brusssels.\n-Reed cheese burger - I wasn't blown away, but it was a good burger. I did really enjoy the fries though.\n-Pear upside-down cake - The cake was pretty good, but I was more after the cinnamon ice cream. Loved that cinnamon ice cream, wish I just had a bowl of that.\n\nAll in all, everyone was really impressed with the food and service. Definitely will be back!",

Stoney River is a steak joint and so I opted for the prime rib. The hunk of cow that arrived was a perfectly cooked piece of steak (12 ounces? It was bigger than that) au jus with a nice fluffy loaded baked potato. There was very little fat to trim from this monster, but I somehow looked down and the entire thing had been consumed. Because I'm a carnivore and that's what carnivores do.\n\nI did have the tomato caprese to start.

I do not mind that (like IKEA) you need to bring your own bags or buy bags from them...it helps keep prices low AND helps keep plastics out of the environment! I do not mind needing a quarter to get a shopping cart...this also helps keep prices low. \n\nI've been nothing short of thrilled with everything I've gotten from Aldi and I couldn't be happier to find this one relatively close to work. I really really really wish we had one convenient to the Heights neighborhoods (Tampa Heights, Seminole Heights). \n\nSome of my favorite items are:\nBiscoff cookies\nPumpkin seed tortilla chips\nGirl Scout Samoas knockoffs\nFrozen pizzas\nMarinated pork loins\nLean ground beef and turkey\nPumpkin waffles\nSpaetzle\nAll the organic canned goods\nRanch flavored mini rice cakes\nAlmond milk\nCheeses...nothing fancy, but string cheese, shredded cheese, feta, and goat are great staples\nSpinach-feta chicken sausage",

I noticed the place was nearly empty. I didn't care - it was hot out and air conditioned inside.\n\nThe huge menu is full of breakfast choices and other pages of typical diner fare.

I figured reviewing Village Whiskey would kick me off to a good start.  \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 8:00pm and was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I read reviews prior to arriving so I was prepared to wait.  I was still a little surprised at how small this place is.  We decided to wait around by the bar.  After waiting for roughly 25 minutes, a spot opened up at a sit down counter, adjacent to the bar.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered the pickled red and golden beets along with turnips and black kale from their pickled section.  We liked the pickled beets but the turnips and black kale surprisingly where our favorite.  The acidity was mild and the black kale was crisp.  The toppings I ordered on my burger were Rogue Smokey Bleu, caramelized onions, bacon, and a fried egg.  I had high expectations for my burger and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked to perfection.  I wish I knew what grinds of meet they used to create their burgers because they had the right amount of fat to keep them moist and where full of flavor.  I was underwhelmed with the duck fat French fries.  They were okay, but nothing exceptional to me. The S'more milk shake was excellent!  The homemade marshmallow had all the characteristics and nuances of their camp fire cousins.  \n\nI woke up the next day, thinking about the burger I consumed the night before at the Village Whiskey.

Even when the city swelters in summer heat and humidity below, a breeze can often be found up here.  Just beware the relentless sun - especially in the afternoons.\n\nYou can access the Philly side of the bridge easily from the  east side of north 5th street.  Wide open, nicely paved pedestrian/bike routes run above the PATCO tracks on both sides of the bridge, though I have only ever seen the south side open.  The walkway has a noticeable incline heading to the middle of the river, and a similar descent as you head towards Camden.  At each of the two midspan supports, the path widens onto more open pavilion areas that provide a nice lookout down the Delaware.  Towards the Jersey side, you get spectacular views of anything going on at the Camden waterfront or in the Riversharks ballpark.  On the Camden side,  a set of stairs takes you down directly onto the Rutgers Camden campus.\n\nUnless Rutgers Camden is your destination, you should turn right around and head directly back to Philly since this is not a particularly safe area.  That being said, security on the bridge seems pretty alert.  I don't think I have ever run across the bridge without seeing at least one bicycle officer during the trip.  The views of Philly as you head back west are some of the best to be had, and it is MUCH safer to enjoy them from the walkway than it is while driving a car.\n\nObviously, most of my review deals with the awesomeness of crossing the Ben Franklin Bridge on foot.  The only reason this is not a 5-star review is due to some of the clusterf**k traffic issues: lines at tolls, shifting traffic lanes, the crazy fun of figuring out which lane to be in on either side of the bridge, etc.  Fortunately, I do not have to drive it often.",

The place could serve dysentery and I'd still come as often as I could.  Boathouse Row, Kelly Drive, 76, The Zoo Balloon, 30th Street Station, The Art Museum- just a lovely panorama view of the city, and the river actually looks pretty!\n\n4) The food- while it COULD be awful, it isn't!  It's so so good!  They serve you fresh rolls at the beginning of your meal, and the appetizers are so delicious.  We split a flat-bread, and the octopus.  For my entree I got the grilled vegetable sandwich and fresh fries.  The fries are twice fried so they have that lovely crisp, and they're perfectly salted.

Sit tight this could be a very long one.\n\nReceptions where your guests can walk back to their room after are so smart here in the midwest where everyone drives.  Though we had a lot of out of town guests who could take advantage.  Loads of free parking, airport shuttle, and free decadent breakfast?  The Crowne Plaza knows what its doing with its mostly business clients.  That is why they're so eager to host events to fill up space when business is slow.\n\nMy parents stayed out of season for us to check out the rooms before.  Their rate was under $100.  For our memorial day weekend wedding guests, I think it was under $115 which I was pleased with.  In Clayton, you have a downtown feel and plenty of good businesses within walking distance.  Sushi Ai (with all you can eat sushi) is one of my favorites.  The ballroom has a cool view of the skyline even if it is less memorable than by the arch.\n\nThe price was a little high but weddings always are.  When your vendors hear wedding, they always seem to triple the price of everything.  If you choose to host an even here, I would recommend you estimate a smaller wedding than you expect.  So you sign a contract with the  smallest possible contractual minimum where you still get the space that you would like.  I think we laughed at their first price or two they offered us and were pleasantly surprised how much they came down.  That is the haggling game and it is always beneficial to know when you're playing it because you don't want to be that rude person who doesn't support their living wage.  A negative wrinkle here when calculating price is that there is no rental fee.  So when you have your event, gratuity is included on the FULL PRICE.  Not that big of a deal, just makes it harder to compare 1 to 1 prices with other event spaces.\n\nBrenda was our main liaison helping us create a wonderful experience for our guests.  Crowne plaza eventually had 4-6 people deal with us and sharing information or passing responsibilities was not their strong suit.  With Brenda's job as mostly the sales person or leader, it is too much to have her be the only person to work with us.  Things just didn't go as well with anyone else.  We showed up to a food tasting as just a couple and brought food for four more home!  Having them hold a block of rooms for guests was not as easy as it should have been.  We didn't have to give them a deposit or anything, but with 200 wedding guests, they will all seem to book around the same time while they only \"hold\" 20 rooms at a time.  It was far too much hastle for us and our guests to go back and forth to get the wedding  group rate.  Don't pester the bride and groom with little details they can fix without us.\n\nThe day of, it was not easy to check in the bride and groom.  The chef/man who was actually in charge had a few issues with our plan which messed up our receiving line so there were guests we literally did not see.  They made us cut cake early even though we had almost no cake and picked other dessert treats so \"cutting the cake\" could come at the end.\n\nBut honestly it was such a great day.  Basically every wedding guest had a wonderful time.  So did the wedding party.  The crowne plaza had a chocolate fountain (check yes for this chocoholic).  Enough space for a very active dance floor that included my 88 year old grandmother.  Higher end alcohol than most venues with generous pours.  4-5 hours of open bar and our different friend groups got along so well they went out after so the fun didn't stop.  We've been to like 12 weddings since our own and I'm not even biased.  I know people don't usually say bad things to you about your wedding but it really was a good time and the Crowne Plaza was in integral part in that.  I can't imagine it any other way.",

Kobe offers sushi, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, a hibachi grill, a pho soup bar, ice cream bar. Easily worth the $13 for an adult.  I was surprised that the food looked so fresh. \n\nFor sushi, the rolls were fairly basic so if you primarily want sushi I would head to Sushi Kingdom down the street. But, they have sushi chefs making the rolls during dinner so the sushi here is fresh. \n\nYou also can't beat the price for the value. I don't know where these other reviewers eat at but one oyster at most restaurants is $1.75 with a half dozen being around $11. I had a half dozen and two sushi rolls which easily covered my buffet price...and then of course I had a salad, fresh fruit, and hibachi to round it out. Def worth $13. \n\n Text2: Deeeeeeeeeeelish. Coming from Philadelphia I'm used to two burgers: the frilly gastropub blue cheese applewood smoked bacon brioche bun burger or the fake fast food burger. The Habit is right in the middle: a true no nonsense burger that tastes great.\n\nTheir spot on Hollister is nice. They have ample outdoor tables and it just feels like California. Any place where I get to order at an outside window is my jam, and a place that gives free pepperoncinis just for the hell of it is also a total score. \n\nI got the #2 Double Char and it was a mistake: that's a lot of meat and a single would have been totally enough. The burger, bun, cheese, etc. taste really fresh though I can't say for certain that these are fresh, never frozen patties (or hand-made patties from that matter). Either way it's good. It automatically comes with pickles, shredded lettuce (beware, lettuce haters!), sauteed carmelized onions, mayo and a slice of tomato. Cheese is 50¢ extra and you can get avocado for a dollar. The fries and onion rings are not freshly made or anything, but they hit the spot. They have a soda fountain facing out so you can get free soda refills. They also gave us little cups of ranch without us even having to ask--they offered it. Who doesn't love that?\n\nAnother note: You can eat healthy here. I saw a lady doing it as I walked by with my double char, fries and soda. Fail. Anywho, there is a grilled chicken sandwich, tuna fillet sandwich, veggie burger and lots of salads on the menu. I think anyone can eat happy here.",

I liked the decor of the place and it makes you feel like you stepped back in time a bit, but the meal itself was just Ok for us. My wife is gluten free and it was a bit hard to find stuff on the menu that she could eat. We started with nachos for an appetizer. I thought they were pretty good, but she was just OK with it. Her $10 margarita wasn't very strong. Lots of toppings on each chip which I liked! For her entree, she went a chicken sandwich minus the bread and a side salad while I went with the meatloaf. The meals were OK but nothing special. You certainly got plenty of it and I didn't hungry by any means. Not many GF choices for her, so she had to go with the mixed berry sorbet while I went with the Banana Cream Pie. The pie was delicious. All in all, an OK meal, but she doesn't want to go back. \n\n Text2: In general, I like Kiwi and was in the Pottstown area and craving froyo late at night, and luckily found this location. We got there about 10 minutes before the 10pm closing time, and I was amazed at how packed it still was. I've been to three different Kiwi locations now and they are setup the same with both indoor and outdoor (limited) seating. As crowded as these places get, there never seems to be enough seating available. \n\nYou start off my picking up your cup (or waffle cup) and then select one or more from 16 foryo flavors to pour into your cup. I like to put 2-3 different flavors in mine. Next up are the toppings and you can pick from fresh fruit to candy to nuts to syrups. If you've been to any other froyo place, you'll find many of the same toppings here. Finally, place your cup on the scale and see how much your owe. Current pricing is $0.45 an ounce. They do offer a rewards program where you get $4 off your total once you get 10 punches. \n\nThe area where you get your toppings was pretty messy. I understand how easy it is to get it this way as some of those toppings can pour out pretty quickly, but someone should be coming by and wiping it up more frequently. Maybe because it was towards the end of the night, the workers figured they were going to have to clean up soon anyways. \n\nAll in all, not a bad location and we like the yogurt here.",

Okay, so it is true that 5 \"sewage plants\" drain into this river...but there's a word missing there: They are sewage TREATMENT plants. They go through great trouble to clean that water before releasing it into public streams...and when it is released, it is water, and nothing else! So, it's perfectly fine to swim in, and you can even catch & eat fish from it. Don't drink it of course (like any stream), but you're much better off swimming in this water than you would be in the Delaware or Schuylkill !\nLastly, I will repeat that you should leave this place as you found it.

We live here and are very familiar with all of the places in the area, know the owners / staff, etc.\n\nThe owners here are always here and are extremely attentive, almost to a fault.  Bar & wait staff are stable.\n\nFood is eclectic; adaptations of Island styles to local ingredients and tastes.  It has to be better to satisfy the many locals who are the backbone of business.\n\nIn this, or any other locally-owned establishment, speak up (politely) if there is a problem.  Your concerns will be addressed promptly.\n\nThe live music is typical of the area, with occasional Caribbean Bands.  Daytimes, it is typically local easy-listening jazz.  If you desire a \"disco\", this is not it.  Remember, you are about 100' from the French Quarter, not in LasVegas.  \n\nThe tropical theme patio is a cool & comfortable place to people-watch as the streetlife of the Quarter and Marigny flows by. \n\nYes, try the \"house mojito\", but be careful, as I have watched them made; they are more than full-strength.  Try the \"calamari\" appetizer.  Ask your server's suggestions.\n\nMojito's is a clean, comfortable, honest, & welcoming retreat in a very convenient location.  A great \"base\" for on-foot expeditions into Marigny's music venues, the nearby French Market, RiverWalk, Museums, & French Quarter attractions.\n\nRick",

I could barely finish it. Like it's rare I truly consider a cocktail to be \"bad\", but it was bad. Also, there is nowhere really to sit with a group unless you are doing bottle service. We were probably here less than a hour. I would've waited a little longer to see if the place livened up, but between the overpriced gross drinks and nowhere to sit, we all wanted to leave.",

Yes, the decor and space is outdated, but it was clean to my eye, and apparently quite popular as it was pretty busy with both Asians and Caucasians over a recent weekday lunch hour.\n\nThey only offer one size for the bun bo hue. A pot of tea came out right away, soon after followed by a plate of sprouts, Thai basil, and a lime wedge. The noodle soup didn't take too long to come out, piled high with purple and green cabbage, sliced onions, and green onions. Not too much spicy oil floating on the top. I ate about half of the bowl and then added more spicy oil from the jar at the table - unfortunately, it is NOT the same stuff so it ended up altering the taste in an unfavourable way :( Anyway, prior to that, the broth was pretty good, though not as lemongrass-y as I had been expecting. There is an excellent noodle to meat/broth ratio (whereas Xu Hue, my current favourite bun bo hue place, has too many noodles). The meats were mostly brisket-type beef, and a variety of homemade meatballs/meatloaf. Good, but I think I prefer the meats at Xu Hue better. \n\nAll in all, it hasn't replaced Xu Hue as my favourite, but I would come back, and make sure to ask for extra spicy bun bo hue next time :)",

It was a pain to find parking, but there is actually a parking lot behind the restaurant which is easily missed and entered from a back road. The chips and salsa they give you to start were great. To drink, I ordered a regular margarita, which was perfect. For my entree, I ended up ordering the meat quesadilla which was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. It was very filling, though. Service was about average. Prices were reasonable. The restaurant was a little too loud for me, especially for a Wednesday night. Overall, a good experience. I would try it again if in the area.",

The bread was perfection and there was a huge slice of tomato in the middle two different types of cheese. The sandwich came with Home made potato chips and was about $8. I'm not a huge fan of potato chips but these happened to be outstanding!

I wound up using another shop to have the work done, but wanted to share my experience.   A tour bus clipped the back bumper of my Smart Car while I was parked on 12th & State.  Thankfully a coworker saw the event and I was able to track down the bus.  I began asking around about body shops and Westside Body Works was one of two that came HIGHLY recommended.  Now though if the Federal Way location is where the folks who recommended them went, or if it was another location. \nTHE AWESOME;  My first contact was by email.  I sent photos, a copy of a competitors estimate and other details via the company website.  I heard back from (and exchanged a few more emails) with Mindy.   She advised me to take my car for a hands on estimate.  So I talked to Reed at the Federal Way location, and made plans to be there when they opened one morning.  They were just opening, so I didn't expect the waiting area to be warm (in terms of temperature) but I was surprised that it wasn't even a little bit inviting.  No one was at the desk right inside the door, and I waited while another customer ranted on the phone to her insurance company and then (in tandem) to the gentlemen behind the counter.  I filled out a basic information form and waited someone said they were going to take a look.  They didn't take my car into the shop, so I know the didn't look any further at the damage than the cosmetic.  This surprised me since I'd told them I'd been hit by a bus- I expected they might put the car up on a rack to make sure there was no damage that couldn't be seen by the naked eye. \nThe gentleman who had been looking at my car, came to get my keys so he could record the mileage.  He then came in and asked me to wait while he input some information to a computer to generate an estimate. \nAnother shop had recommended that the damaged panel be replaced.  Westside Body Works recommended that the damage be repaired.   The estimate was almost FOUR times what I'd been quoted elsewhere for replacing the damaged panel.   When I asked about replacing the panel, I was told that it is 'best to stay with the original parts'.  When I asked about making the repair work blend in with the paint (my car is 7 years old and a bit faded) he assured me they'd color match the paint and make it work.  This kind of scared me, because the lady ranting with her insurance company and the men in the office was doing so over the paint work they'd done on replacement parts for her daughters Jeep.  \nIn the end, when I submitted my estimates to the bus company we settled on going with the other shop (and you can bet I'll be reviewing them from start to finish). \nI really REALLY wanted to love my experience with Westside Body Works because Mindy in customer service was SO SO AWESOME.   Unfortunately that same care and concern did not filter down from email to in person service.",

Soooo overwhelming. I had no idea what to order. Like I said earlier, they have tons of toppings. You could make your own, or order from a set menu they have.\n\nI went with the Cinncinnati. It was a 3 cheese sauce with beef chili and onions and scallions. It was great! The sauce and chili was so flavorful. I normally do not get full off of one hotdog, but they stuff these things to the max that I was overly stuffed 3/4 of the way through. I also ordered fries (cause that's what I was currently craving) with a cilantro lime mayo. Loved the sauce! I don't know how to describe the sauce, so you just have to get it. My husband ordered he surf n turf dog. It was fried fish with a hot dog and topped with veggies. I too really enjoyed this. For my son, I ordered just a plain dog. I don't really recommend it though. The dog is very very thin compared to the bread. You definately need toppings with the type of bread that is used.

The shop is pretty simple, stripped down and bare with a nice area to view the rhythmic chopping of the ice cream. The wait was a little too long for this to be worth while, about an hour and a half. The heat and mass of people in the shop did not make the experience any better, some ladies started to get worked up with me when they misunderstood me talking to my friends. Standing and watching the ice cream being made and rolled is pretty cool unless you're literally watching 10s of ice creams being made that aren't yours. It's an interesting concept, but they really need to expedite it some how, they had a whole rolling station that was not being utilized even with enough workers to man it. Also only having one girl topping the ice creams created a real and tangible bottle neck in service. I'm glad I came with friends because we didn't get the same ice creams and I could taste a bunch of different kinds. The ice cream is harder and icier than I'd like and had week flavor. The toppings don't really do much to add flavor but they look great for the obligatory Instagram photo. I don't think I'd want to waste another 2 hours to get a mediocre ice cream.",

This last time sealed the deal and I'm sad to say we probably won't return (there's way too many other fantastic places to eat at!)\nWe went for happy hour and were super disappointed! We ordered cocktails (margarita for me, mojito for my friend) and they were just \"meh.\" We started with a shrimp and avocado salsa. Although the flavors were good, the preparation of the salsa was a joke! It came out with the bottom half being chopped up shimp and salsa. On top was a quarter of an avocado, basically sitting in one chunk. I couldn't believe they didn't even bother to mix it together - pure laziness on part of the chef!\nI got a mini bbq chicken pizza afterward, which was alright. Nothing special, but not bad either. My friend got a burger that was TERRIBLE! I guess after the burger is cooked they put cheese on top and throw it under the broiler for a bit to melt the cheese. Well, they must have forgotten about it, because the cheese was completely burned! It was disgusting!! Inedible!! When she sent it back, the manager came out with the \"fixed\" burger (same burger patty - new cheese on top), but didn't offer to comp a drink, or appetizer, or anything. Having worked in the restaurant industry for years, I find this to be a mistake on her part. After the \"fix\" the burger was still pretty gross. After being double-cooked the meat was tough and dried out and the toppings (lettuce, onion rings, etc.) were now soggy and gross.\n\nSad to see that CJ has jumped the ship, so to speak, but it appears it has.

Mel's Kitchen fits the bill.\n\nMel's is located in a small stand-alone building on Umbria St. Slightly dilapidated, it easily goes unnoticed unless you happen to know of it's existence (thanks to Yelp, of course). \n\nThe first time I went was around 8 am. I seated myself at one of 3 open tables (4 in total) and Mel herself came over and poured me a cup of coffee in a brightly colored mug. That was the first moment I started to fall in love with this place: Mel doesn't use those miniature white coffee mugs you see in most diners - these mugs are huge and look like she took them right out of her own personal kitchen. \n\nThe second thing that struck me was that there's Sriracha on every table. Mel's clearly knows the best breakfast condiment and doesn't make you request it.\n\nDespite my love of Sriracha I was craving something sweet, so I ordered the French toast and bacon (extra crispy). The kitchen is in the same room as the dining area so I was able to watch Mel happily work away on my food while she cooked a few breakfast sandwiches for the customers sitting at the bar right in front of the griddle. Clearly those patrons were regulars as they chatted about their kids' little league and the scorching hot weather.\n\nSoon my breakfast was delivered to me and oh my, was it delicious! The bacon was perfectly crispy and the French toast was delectable. The portion was quite large - 3 slices of toast and about 5 strips of bacon.\n\nI think my bill was about $8. Of course I didn't notice the large sign stating they take credit card for bills over $10 - so I threw in a Mel's Kitchen t-shirt (which is a really cute play off of the Hell's Kitchen logo).\n\nWith all the thoughtful touches and Mel's down to earth, amiable personality I truly felt at home here. I've since been back for take out breakfast sandwiches and I continue to be impressed by the service and food quality. This is now my favorite no-frills breakfast spot.",

This resulted in a large gash on the side of his neck. It was yesterday (a Sunday afternoon) and therefore, all of the \"vet hospitals\" in my area were closed. I don't think they should be considered hospitals if they don't take emergency visits. I've heard of Univ. of Penn in the past and heard it is very expensive but I didn't have a choice at this point. I was disappointed that I was never told what a great hospital this was for emergency cases.\n\nWe were seen by a nurse within 2 seconds of our arrival. We did not call ahead. He was taken back right away and a nurse took information about what happened. We waited about five minutes then were asked if its ok to give him pain medication through a catheter. Of course we said it was ok. About 10 minutes after that they asked us to come to the back again for another report of what happened. We explained again and they were very interested in the scissors that were used in case there was bacteria or rust they should be worried about. We explained the scissors and were told exactly what they were going to do to our little Sammy. We were told it would take 2 hours to clean him up so we were able to go home and come back. \n\n3 stitches, $420 bucks (no pet insurance) and 2 1/2 hours later, Sammy was back at home completely shaved, nails cut and surprisingly full of energy. The stitches will have to be removed in 10-14 days but according to the doc, this will be free of charge. We also have the option of removing them at our regular Vet's office. \n\nThe hospital was very impressive. You'd think it was a hospital for people. The staff was quick but thorough and very nice. UPenn is definitely expensive but you could tell where the money is going. Even if you wish you'd never have to visit this place, you should at least know where it is in case of an emergency.

I dreamed I would be able to find a non-corporate, personable cafe and coffee shop to come to in the morning, meet friends, have a great cuppa, and contemplate the scent of the beautiful gulf breeze. I found that and a lot more at Old Town!\n\nThe coffee is from Baby's Coffee with roasting locations in Key West, Florida and Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, The bread is from Giovanni's Bakery in Largo, Fl. Desserts and pies come from J.J. Gandy's (famous for their Key Lime pies) right here in Palm Harbor.\n\nThe breakfast items include, bagels croissants, paninis,  all available as sandwiches. I've almost tried them all as I will never turn away an offered bite from friends!  Belgian Waffles, a breakfast Cuban, Panini, or Burrito? No worries. Breakfast is available all day!\n\nBut the choice of sandwiches, salads, soups, and wraps go on and on for great cafe lunches. I can't do it justice. I can say that as I'm doing this review, I'm inspired by the amazing Chicken Salad sandwich (w chopped grapes), with fresh lettuce and tomatoes on whole wheat! \n\nThere was recently a turnover in ownership. This has not affected the great service and friendliness as a familiar staff member/customer took the reins. In fact, they are constantly asking their customers, local and new, for ideas. \n\nYes, many mornings on the front deck, my friends and I are enjoying the menu, sharing random thoughts, and loving the coastal life at Old Town Cafe.

My disclaimer: I'm a 30 year old childless woman so yea there's that. It was a lot of little kids. Everywhereeeee people just running. Apparently Saturday is Birthday Party Central with like 5 parties going on at once probably all under the age of 10. \n\nPros.\n1. Its kind of dark in here for those special neon lights (or whatever they are called) so specific neon colors on your clothes can glow. The glow is fun and funny especially for kids. Not so fun if you are an adult and only thing glowing is your bra. So just be careful but very fun for the kiddies.\n\n2. The Juice. I'm not sure what it is (probably Hawaiian punch) but it's like crack. I don't get much sugar in me these days but that juice had me pumped up and wanting more.\n\n3. Pizza. The pizza is very good and filling and especially good if you allow your kids to eat pizza. You may even get away with one slice per person.\n\n4. Bowling. Lots of fun bowling. Good thing is if you have a lot of little little kids with you, they actually do not need to change their shoes; only the teenagers and adults.\n\nCons.\n1. KIDS KIDS KIDS.  If you hate kids, well don't go here during the day on Saturdays. Well you probably shouldn't go a lot of places.\n\n2. Parking. Parking can be a tad scarce on popular days so be prepared for that possibility.\n\nOverall this is a great place for a bowling party.",

1,"I was going back and forth over 4 or 5 stars.  As you can see I gave it a 5.  I went to lunch and ordered their luncheon special which included a soft drink Greek salad and main course of beef kabob, rice, vegetables, and a desert.

The Greek salad of course had feta cheese on it.  I have never tasted a milder feta in my life.  I like feta but it can be powerful and salty this feta was mild and was a total compliment to the salad.  The beef kabob was cooked to my request of medium rare and the rice and vegetable were fresh cooked great not mushy had a slight crunch.  
 So why was I thinking about 4 stars and not 5.  I guess a 5 should be just so outstanding it is a stand out meal.  Some gentleman ask me if my meal was good.  I said to him it is not good or very good it is excellent.  And I thought how can I tell him my food was outstanding and give the place 4 stars? 

This place has been around a long time and I have eaten here a few times.

 Good job Spiro's keep up the good work!","Sapore sits in the old location of Wholly Mackerel.  They have been open for about 6 months.  On a whim my wife and I stopped by for supper on Saturday.  We were darn lucky to get a table for two.  By 7:15 all the tables were taken and these people had reservations.  This is not a simple little Italian restaurant.  It has a menu that is only a left side and a right side and maybe 3 specials that the wait staff will inform you just as they come up to take your order.  So my pasta dish that I was going to order changed to a veal chop Saltimbocca.  The chop was cooked to perfection and the prosciutto and mozzarella on top was very tasty;  My wife had a chicken dish that was fried and battered served with copious amounts of garlic the name was Siciliano it would be your choice of veal or chicken.  My wife ordered a pasta side dish instead of the vegetables.  One word fantastic.  We did not have a salad but we ordered the anti pasta plate it has a unique name of Salaumi.  It came with mozzarella, salami, mortadella,  prosciutto and a pickled relish of cauliflower carrots and peppers.  Very nice.  The only down side to me was the portions were on the small side.  $32.00 for the veal special seemed to me a lot of money for the small amount of veal and vegetables.

You do get a touch of Italy here because the menu has a lot of Italian then like you see in Italy and then has English to describe the dish.  I thought it was cute but odd.","Text1: I was going back and forth over 4 or 5 stars.  As you can see I gave it a 5.

1,"Quick follow up to my previous review. The Churchill burger is ridiculous, the brussels sprouts are out of this world, and the bone marrow appetizer makes me want to cut off my own leg. That is all. Enjoy!","I've been dying to try Federal Donuts since they first opened their flagship location. So a few weekends back when we happened to be in the neighborhood, we finally had our chance! 

We walked into the small storefront and were greeted by a warm smile behind the counter. We settled on a half order of the buttermilk ranch chicken and six chili garlic style wings (which we were told were excellent choices btw.) The lovely lady behind the counter told us she'd cut us a break and just charge us for the whole chicken instead of two halves to save a buck. 

Then of course, we needed to decide on donuts. Lots of their specialty donuts were sold-out so we stuck with the classics. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and Bry went with the Apollonia Spice, then as if our day couldn't get any better, the sweet lady behind the counter told us she would throw in the Vanilla Lavendar for free, just so we could try it! Bam! They just earned themselves a lifelong customer. The inside of the store is minimalist and charming, there are about six seats at the counter so if there is an open spot, snatch it up quick!

The buttermilk ranch was my absolute favorite. I loved the flavor and crispiness of the outside and the chicken was crazy moist on the inside. I've had dreams about it every night since I first got my hands on it. 

Please note: and we were newbies so we had no idea, with every order of chicken you get a tasty honey lemon donut to go along (pictured below.) It's really the perfect compliment to the chicken -- a little savory and a little sweet. If I had known that we might not have ordered three other donuts, but heck, you live and you learn.","Text1: Quick follow up to my previous review.

1,Orchid Thai is my new favorite Thai restaurant!  I've spent years patronizing an establishment in Odessa and honestly the food and the friendly owner absolutely blows my former place out of the water!  Thank you Samantha for such wonderful food!,"Good little buffet. They didn't have the usual fare though. No sesame chicken. No honey chicken and the general Tao's was a bit odd. The rest of the food was quite tasty however. The ranging were flavorful as were the dim sum.  The price for lunch was very reasonable, less than $7.00. I really liked the hibachi area, chicken and shrimp were the meat options and broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms and noodles for mixing.","Text1: Orchid Thai is my new favorite Thai restaurant!

1,"Gardening requires a lot of water - most of it in the form of perspiration.  If you want to sweat a little less you buy plants at a quality greenhouse.  True gardeners would rather poke a stick in their eye than buy plants at Home Depot or Lowes.  You may get a good price but you just don't get the quality.

Russell Gardens is a great family owned greenhouse.  Break out your GPS to get there as it's out in the boondocks.  These folks have a split personality.  There is the retail operation and 100 yards down the road with a separate parking lot is the wholesale site.  Why should you care?  Read on.

The retail operation is well run with hundreds of annuals and perennials.  Most of the plants are grown on site.  This is a big deal because your purchases are acclimated to this area and that makes them more likely to survive and thrive.  Prices are completive with other greenhouses.

So what about this wholesale operation?  Wouldn't it be great to get in there and pay wholesale prices?  Savvy gardeners know the secret!  The greater Philly area has dozens and dozens of gardening clubs and societies.   The Russell Gardens folks are smart and allow folks that are members of select clubs to visit the wholesale side and pay wholesale prices.  This is an entirely different world.  It is not as pretty as the retail side as this is where all the plants are grown.  You'll find yourself wandering along row after row of giant greenhouses.  The lovely wife and I visited yesterday as we are members of the Delaware Valley Water Garden Society (DVWGS).  We loaded up on quality plants at great prices.  

So if you are a serious gardener and like a great deal, find a club in your area has this relationship.  Most cubs only cost a few bucks to join and it can be well worth the investment.","The lovely wife and I were Living the Dream!

1. We were on our way to a new place my fellow Yelpers were raving about.
2. Cambodian was a new ethnicity for us. Very exciting!
3. It was BYOB which we always appreciate.
4. On our first pass we snagged a parking spot less than a block away. Very lucky in this crowded part of South Philly.
5. We walked in to this tiny cozy place at 3 PM on a Sunday and snagged a table right away.

Everything was going so well it was time for a bump in the road. The first thing our very pleasant waiter did was list the seven items, that's right seven items, which they were out of.  This included all the skewers and several other dishes. The carnivore in me was completely ready for those beautiful sticks of meat and I was to be denied.

It turns out that they were slammed on Friday and Saturday and this was the result. Also, it's happened before. LESSON LEARNED- Sunday afternoon maybe great for snagging a table but bad for availability of menu items!

So with limited choices available we picked PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH ($8) as our appetizer. It was delicious and a perfect way to begin our meal. Some folks may think that dipping raw vegetables into a meat sauce is a little odd but trust me, it works.

For our meal we decided to split two dishes. The first was PLEAH SACH-KHOE. This was delicious marinated beef with kaffir lime and lemongrass. It was so good it was beyond five stars for both of us.

We also devoured a CHICKEN CURRY STEW that was incredible. The texture and layers of flavor in the broth brought smiles to both of our faces.

The wife and I both love this place and we'll be back but not on a Sunday afternoon.  We understand it's tiny and family run but seven items off the small menu was a big disappointment.  However the food was so incredibly good that I'm awarding four stars.","Text1: Gardening requires a lot of water - most of it in the form of perspiration.

1,"Absolutely terrible delivery experience. First off, the delivery person called me, the recipient, to complain about how he could not ""fit me into his schedule."" He ranted for nearly 5 minutes while I was still at work. I tried to politely inform him that I was the gift recipient and perhaps he should inform the sender instead. He cut me off and continued talking about how the company usually doesn't do any deliveries after 5pm despite being able to schedule this time with the company beforehand. I ended the phone call flustered and having pushed my time to 4:15pm to suit the needs of this delivery person.

Hearing of my situation, the gift sender complained to management who responded that they do, in fact, deliver after 5pm. Surprise, surprise. This employee was simply trying to get off work early. When the package finally arrived, the fruit was fine, but...let's talk about the balloon.

This was the saddest balloon I have ever seen in my life. It sings, but it was COMPLETELY deflated, despite the delivery person's assurance that it was simply due to the cold. No. This balloon had a hole in it. I photographed it for Yelp and for my own dry humor. 

Never again. I'll make my own chocolate-covered strawberries, thank you.","I've been waiting over $200 with limited assistance and little interaction. While they have a decent range of affordable mattresses, the staff seems quite slow and unavailable if they have more than one customer. God forbid they get more than one customer, you are guaranteed at least a thirty minute wait. Not to mention, the staff didn't even lift a finger to help.

[Update:] The service you do receive is really kind and personal. The attendant will go above and beyond to make sure you get the mattress you like at the price on the tag with a decent delivery service. I had to call and change my delivery time, and the attendant was perfectly okay with the time, changing it in a few minutes.

1,"The first dinner out for our Philly family feastgiving. We called many weeks ahead, they were unable to accommodate a party of 12 so they said they would set up two tables of 6. (at least they were willing, unlike another orange colored squash restaurant) Kind of ridiculous since all the tables are two tops, just make some tetris like moves and make it happen. 

Like other reviewers we showed up a few minutes early for our reservation. One table was set the other we had to wait almost 30 minutes for. Thankfully there was another large party celebrating a birthday so as we moved from table to table to visit we weren't a disruption. 

The service of constantly rotating silverware and wine pouring was friendly and timely. A sense of humor shared for our carlo rossi growler. The little clover bread rolls were delicious and they brought more upon request. 

Items that were sampled, 

Scallops that had a wonderful crispy pan sear. The lardons were crisp. 

Beet salad seemed to have the beet skin intact, which was a puzzler but delicious. 

Kampachi, just lightly seared which had a smokey undertone and bright pomegranate. 

Stuffed rabbit saddle, very mild, tender and highlighted by a herb sauce and truffle.

Stripped bass was seared well, the vegetables were well seasoned and caramelized. 

Duck breast was served rare, some slices were a but chewy, the farro and veg a great consistency.

Boar shank was fall apart tender atop greens, hearty winterish meal.

Pappardelle with pork shoulder ragu was another winterish meal, with tender diced veg. 

Strip steak was cooked as ordered, blue corn polenta wasn't a favorite of anyone, but the brussels sprouts were well caramelized

We ended with a few chocolate napoleons, the filo dough was treated with caramel and sea salt, highlighted with fresh whipped cream. It was a nice rich yet light end bite. 

We all had a great time and would return. Overall comments concluded that the protein servings were inconsistent but the vegetable preparations were spot on.","Ordered take out, everything was warm, well cooked and I thought a decent serving amount. Very good, medium spice versus mild spice is noticeably different. The tandoori chicken wings were very tender and flavorful. Their paneer was dense, naan thin and a bit crisp. The palak paneer was thick with spinach. I liked the shahi paneer I've only found a buttery sweet creamy dish like this in one other restaurant.","Text1: The first dinner out for our Philly family feastgiving.

1,"The thing about Kanella is strange. The restaurant is only half a block to my apartment, so I pass by it all the time and after trying it for the very first time when it first opened. I couldn't honestly call myself a fan. What can I say? I ordered the kebob and everybody who knows anything about Greek/Turkish food is that kebobs are the most generic thing on the menu and can't really reflect the skills of the chef. On top of that the restaurant is popular and the space is small with tables arranged very closed to each other and I'm a bit claustrophobic. At the end of the meal I freaked out  a little and had to run out of the restaurant to catch a breath. After that experience I was a bit afraid to go back. Then there was a pretty long and angry respond to a newspaper review that got pasted on the window of the kitchen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got weirded out by it.

It wasn't until Food Network's The Best Thing I've Ever Ate that got me pay more attention to my Greek neighbor. I went back for the Cyprus breakfast promoted by the program and it was good, real good. Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. 

A second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window. Even off-putting at times, a grouchy Greek chef may signifies a chef of standards. Now only if they can find a bigger place to host their restaurants.","I saw this place listed as a top-trending place on the yelp site and started imagining having a cheap date night with my boyfriend. Hot dog is a fun and affordable food that we both like to make at home. We'd usually bring out all the gourmet sauces and nicknacks to dress it up, so when I read that Hot Diggity has 10 different kinds of gourmet dogs and 12 different sauces for fries to dip in I was instantly sold.

Upon entering the place, you'll see three long community bench with holes in them to put their french fry cones in and high stools surrounding them. Instead of menu, they have hot dog drawings describing the looks and ingredients in the dogs in detail. I've seen those style of hot dogs drawings from Serious Eats before and it turned out it IS from the blog's Hawk Krall. After much discussion, we decided on having the Saigon Fusion, the Seattle Grunge and the Fiesta Dog. The guy behind the counter offered to cut them all in half for us so we can try all of them which we DO! In addition to the dogs we also got a regular size french fries cone, a small curry mayo and a rosemary aioli dipping sauce. 

Saigon Fusion was essentially a banh mi with a hot dog in the middle. All the ingredients were pretty on point and it tasted pretty good. Seattle Grunge was more like a traditional hot dog but with cream cheese. I wouldn't think cream cheese would go well with hot dogs but apparently it did, the combination really complimented the meat flavor and it stood out. Fiesta dog was like a taco, I like the guacamole, sour cream and salsa fresca combination, I wouldn't be mad if they put a little cilantro on it and the fresh lime slice accompanied was a nice touch. 

The fries here are a bit on the thick, softer side. While I enjoy the curry mayo immensely, the rosemary aioli is a bit subtle, suitable for more sophisticated palettes. 

There's a slight awkwardness to the place. I don't enjoy the holes on the bench where small things like the dipping sauces could potentially fall through, and the stool and bench are too close together. If the place become popular and packed, you might not be able to get out. I also can't decide if the bread is stale. The bite of the bread is a bit hard and not in the crusty crispy way. If the bread is delivered in the morning, does it mean that the dogs won't be as good at night? The flavor of the dogs are also not distinct enough to compete with the dressings. Having that said, they're still good.

The dogs were around $5 - $7 each, the fries were like $4. Getting 3 dogs, an order of fries, 2 dipping sauce and 2 sodas were altogether about $25 in total. We'll definitely be back for more. I think it'd be the perfect stop for a light snack on South Street and there are still many more things to try and they are going to have beer soon.

Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. 

A second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window. Even off-putting at times, a grouchy Greek chef may signifies a chef of standards. Now only if they can find a bigger place to host their restaurants. 

 Text2: I saw this place listed as a top-trending place on the yelp site and started imagining having a cheap date night with my boyfriend. Hot dog is a fun and affordable food that we both like to make at home. We'd usually bring out all the gourmet sauces and nicknacks to dress it up, so when I read that Hot Diggity has 10 different kinds of gourmet dogs and 12 different sauces for fries to dip in I was instantly sold.

Upon entering the place, you'll see three long community bench with holes in them to put their french fry cones in and high stools surrounding them. Instead of menu, they have hot dog drawings describing the looks and ingredients in the dogs in detail. I've seen those style of hot dogs drawings from Serious Eats before and it turned out it IS from the blog's Hawk Krall. After much discussion, we decided on having the Saigon Fusion, the Seattle Grunge and the Fiesta Dog. The guy behind the counter offered to cut them all in half for us so we can try all of them which we DO! In addition to the dogs we also got a regular size french fries cone, a small curry mayo and a rosemary aioli dipping sauce. 

Saigon Fusion was essentially a banh mi with a hot dog in the middle. All the ingredients were pretty on point and it tasted pretty good. Seattle Grunge was more like a traditional hot dog but with cream cheese. I wouldn't think cream cheese would go well with hot dogs but apparently it did, the combination really complimented the meat flavor and it stood out. Fiesta dog was like a taco, I like the guacamole, sour cream and salsa fresca combination, I wouldn't be mad if they put a little cilantro on it and the fresh lime slice accompanied was a nice touch. 

The fries here are a bit on the thick, softer side. While I enjoy the curry mayo immensely, the rosemary aioli is a bit subtle, suitable for more sophisticated palettes. 

There's a slight awkwardness to the place. I don't enjoy the holes on the bench where small things like the dipping sauces could potentially fall through, and the stool and bench are too close together. If the place become popular and packed, you might not be able to get out. I also can't decide if the bread is stale. The bite of the bread is a bit hard and not in the crusty crispy way. If the bread is delivered in the morning, does it mean that the dogs won't be as good at night? The flavor of the dogs are also not distinct enough to compete with the dressings. Having that said, they're still good.

The dogs were around $5 - $7 each, the fries were like $4. Getting 3 dogs, an order of fries, 2 dipping sauce and 2 sodas were altogether about $25 in total. We'll definitely be back for more. I think it'd be the perfect stop for a light snack on South Street and there are still many more things to try and they are going to have beer soon.

The first thing I noticed is the prices were more moderately priced than everywhere else.  You could get a beef and carrot sandwich on French bread for three bucks and change.  I went with the specialty seafood phó.  It was definitely not Americanized in any way.  There was a plethora of different fish slices, beef, shrimp, and even some gelatinous substance I had no idea what it was.  I consider myself adventurous, but even that part was above my threshold.  There was also some crab meat which I think was imitation.  I got the meal via takeout,  overall I enjoyed the soup.  I'll be back to try out the sandwiches.","Text1: Deep dish pizza.

0,"I've been here four or five times, tried a number of dishes here, and always ask myself why I don't come here more often. The food tastes great and wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. The guacamole is terrific and a must with chips to start off the meal. Sunday brunch is great with a number of options for breakfast only, lunch only, and combinations. I'm a big fan of the huaracha de carne and machaca. This place used to be more crowded, especially with it being a little smaller, but the last couple times it has been very easy to get a table and they do take reservations. My only complaint is they lack a full bar. Everyone raves about the sangria, but it was a bit sweet for me. Then again I don't like sweet drinks so yeah...","Typical (awesome) P.F. Chang's food and atmosphere, fantastic service.

One of Norman's classic principles of design was the concept of consistency - P.F. Chang's China Bistro, amongst a few other notable national chains, certainly delivers on this front.  The food is always very good with the veggie lettuce wraps (always a no brainer), eggplant in garlic sauce (also very good), ma po tofu (must I keep going with the compliments), and banana spring rolls rounding up the veggie components of our family-style dinner.  (Although I did want it all for myself...)

This was the first time that I felt really special in a P.F. Chang's location, and 100% of the credit here goes to our server, Paul.  He was very good with suggestions for the first-timers, and all in all, definitely helped make our experience as special as it was.

Long story short, great food, great service, great ambiance - a must visit.","Text1: I've been here four or five times, tried a number of dishes here, and always ask myself why I don't come here more often.

1,"BEST PRICES= My female-Asian driving ""skills"" led my car to Ace Tires (through a AAA recommendation AND giving the cheapest quote over 8 local repair stores) Once at the tiny shop... cars parked EVERYWHERE in an area smaller than a McDonalds! First come first serve? Uh-oh! 

SERVICE-- They stuck to their quote: full service, mad cheap! Despite the traffic, my car was in and out in less than 2 hours. Several of the passing workers were eager to tell me what they were going to do and how-- great communication between the staff and with me. 

APPEARANCE= All car repairs were very open and visible. With Ace's obvious popularity, this shop deserves a bigger, cleaner, uncluttered space-- in and out. There's a tiny waiting room and nothing to do in the surrounding areas. Most of the car congestion were results of customers trying to self-navigate their way through the factory-line of workers. 

The next time my car rebels, I'll definitely go here!","I predict this to be the next, greatest casual Asian eatery of the bay.

Across from the busy Park Plaza, Season's sits in a small, unassuming plaza. The décor is rather plain... the menu and items for sale are straightforward--totally reminds me of the little Asian cafes in Southern California. Me likey. Small tables for groups of four and lounging areas for chatting.

Honestly--I haven't gotten anything besides the banh mi and shaved ice... and always on the go. But do you need more? Right now the banh mi is on sale for $2! Oooh that crunchy and soft contradiction of a bread housing the pickled veggies and shaved meats. You can taste each ingredient yet it all works in harmony. The shaved ice is light, fluffy snow with lots of variations on toppings. There's always some special to get a free cup of it.

The menu is a collection of Asian fusion: Boba, designer wedding cakes, phad thai, spring rolls, baked goods, and probably a pony ride too if you ask.

It always feels like the staff is wanting me to create familial conversation with them. They're cool. 

Due to its central location and awesome weekend hours (closed at 2am?) plus the ability to just run in and out,  I will be haunting this place more in the future.","Text1: BEST PRICES= My female-Asian driving ""skills"" led my car to Ace Tires (through a AAA recommendation AND giving the cheapest quote over 8 local repair stores) Once at the tiny shop... cars parked EVERYWHERE in an area smaller than a McDonalds!

Chili's wasn't busy, and we were seated rather quickly. Both of us perused the new menu, neither of us saw what we really wanted but did notice that there was a lunch menu that offered relatively cheap food for a low price.  

The server was concientious and quick, but the food was mediocre at best.

They've improved but not a lot.

Quite honestly, the area needs to be larger, as it was the most crowed area of the casino.  I did not appreciate the people who walked towards the bakery STILL SMOKING. That was wholly inconsiderate of the non-smokers. 

Also noticed that they are now charging a $10 parking fee for every car.  Your first half hour is free, but ""All day"" which lets be honest, can be 2 hours or 12 hours, in my opinion the $10 parking rate is ... kind of steep, especially for those who are there frequently (Daily) or those who come only for a little bit of time. Let's also talk about the issue the parking meters have on getting into and out of the parking garage (South), there is inevitably a hold up because they're new, and it takes folks some time to get their ticket and get through the barrier.

I'm not sure I know what they're doing with this fee, but sure, it's a revenue generator.

The Brie sticks were a tasty find, but the blue cheese burger lacked taste and was very dry. Ill probably be back but just for drinks or apps.",yes
1,"This Petsmart is pretty alright. It's usually pretty clean and relatively well-stocked. I don't have pets groomed there but I once called for pricing on having my cat boarded and the rates were a bit high but mostly comparable to other boarding options. My main complaint is this: every single time I visit this store, there is a lengthy check-out line because they only have one cashier working. I'm sure there are times that they have two or more cash registers going at once but I've never witnessed it and I've been at least 6 times this year at different time of day.","When reviewing places like Ted Drewes--and by that I mean places that everyoneeveryoneeveryone says you HAVE to try because it's a Saint Louis ""thing""--I don't really know where to begin. So, as a Saint Louis NON-native, I'm trying to review TD based solely on their goods and service. Is the custard good? No...it's great. They have lots and lots and LOTS of options and they have more than just frozen custard concretes to choose from. They have a variety of sizes so whether you're wanting a wee taste or you're manically craving it, there's a proper size available for you. The service is SO much faster than I anticipated. When you drive by Ted Drewes or look at pictures of the lines online, you might think, ""Screw the wait, I'll just hit up DQ."" But they have a whole row of windows where at least half a dozen servers are popping theirs heads out and getting stuff taken care of, so don't let the hoards fool you. The prices are perfectly reasonable and they accept both cash and credit. The only issue is they don't have much outdoor seating and custard melts fast so you've got to head home pronto, stand around outside, or sit in/on your car. 

So, in the end, I say this: go for the kitsch factor, go for the good custard, or go for the fast-and-friendly service...no matter what, just go. It'll be worth it on a number of levels.","Text1: This Petsmart is pretty alright. It's usually pretty clean and relatively well-stocked.

0,"It is hard to find a new  establishment who consistently delivers not only a tasty product but a unique and friendly experience. Strange Donuts does it all EACH and EVERY time. I tested this theory with multiple visits over the past few months. I wanted to be very sure... also I like donuts. 

I was one of those loyal social media followers who stalked Strange Donuts months ahead of the opening and even attended a few of the preview events. Strange Donuts is the shining example of new small business and I can only hope they are around for a very long time. 

Now to the donuts!! Strange offers up classics, creations and strangers. While I haven't managed to make it to the late night showings of the strangers, the concept of chef collaborations for specialty donuts makes me swoon. Classics are tasty and always fresh. The creations is where Strange finds its calling though. You can tell in the taste and presentation that each donut was carefully crafted.My personal favorite is the campfire, a glorious chocolate cake donut dusted with graham crackers crumbs and topped with a toasted marshmellow. Oh and try the mexican hot chocolate. They kicked up the heat on this little wonder. It's amazing.

In summary: Go eat donuts, enjoy the friendly goofy staff and support this local business so they can be a fixture in Maplewood for years to come.","We were just strolling around Doylestown after a big lunch, but the delicious smell wafting from Hickory Kitchen drew us in. The man behind the counter was friendly and helpful and suggested we opt for cold BBQ and just have it heated once since we would be eating in several hours.

Once home, we excitedly heated our meal, but were disappointed.  The Pound of Pulled Pork was tender, but lacked any flavor on its own (thankfully, a generous portion of Original BBQ sauce was included - other sauce options are also available).  The Mac & Cheese was the best side we tried, but I thought it not consistently cheesy enough.  The Potato Salad is extremely onion-y (skip it if you're on a date) and the Cole Slaw was disappointing more peppery cabbage than the sweet, finely chopped slaw I was hoping for.","Text1: It is hard to find a new  establishment who consistently delivers not only a tasty product but a unique and friendly experience.

0,"Another sports bar!  I suppose we have a lot of them in these parts.  Corner Bar is a pretty run-of-the-mill type of operation.

The patio (as both Robin and Sharon have noted) is nice.  In fact, it's probably my favorite feature of this establishment.

0,"With its combination of Polynesian, Spanish, American, Chinese (and other Asian influences), Filipino food can be a challenge to the uninitiated. My wife and I recently joined a group of perhaps 30 Yelpers for dinner at Cafe de Manila, providing a great opportunity to try a variety of flavors. Although it took a while to get the first orders out, the friendly staff did a pretty good job under the circumstances.

First up, Lumpia ($7.95), thin and crispy pork egg rolls served with a spicy-sweet chili sauce. I've enjoyed lumpia many times, and these did not disappoint. Following was Tokwa't Baboy ($9.95), bite-sized pork belly and tofu chunks stacked together and deep-fried, served with a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. If you love both bacon and Asian food, you'll want this for breakfast. And lunch. And, well, you get the idea.

Next was something I just couldn't abide, Mangga at Bagoong ($5.95), a paste of mashed mango and salted, fermented shrimp. No, no, no. Even the smell was bad enough that I had to move that bowl to an adjacent, empty table. An acquired taste, I presume.

Thankfully, the next item was Laing ($7.95), a delicious mess of shredded taro leaves cooked with coconut milk and ginger, akin to Indian Saag. The leaves were a little tougher than most cooked greens, but the dish was one I'd order again. Even better was Chicken Adobo ($8.95), featuring chunks of chicken cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaf, garlic, and whole peppercorns. My wife and I probably enjoyed this stew the best of all items sampled.

The menu described Pork Menudo ($8.95) as pork meat stew with liver cubes, chickpeas, potatoes, and tomato sauce. My wife took the leftovers for lunch and reported, ""This was similar in flavor to the adobo, though I couldn't detect any liver. Under bright office lighting I realized the meat was actually chunks of hot dog, and there were raisins as well. Very different from the description."" Maybe they weren't prepared for our large group and had to improvise.

Pancit (noodle) dishes are a mainstay and Pancit Palabok ($7.95) sounded amazing, with rice noodles, prawn, smoked fish flake, shrimp, sliced hard-boiled egg, crunchy chicharon, and orange sauce. Yet, I couldn't detect much--if any--shrimp or prawn, though there was plenty of fish flake, egg, chicharon (fried pork rind) and orange sauce. Not something I'd want every day (or week), but good enough I'd like to try it from a different restaurant for comparison.

Kare Kare ($10.95), a stew of oxtail with mixed vegetables cooked in peanut sauce is something I've had better tastes of in the past. The texture of the veggies was odd, and the peanut sauce seemed ""off"". Not terrible, but just not as good as I know it can be. Last of the entrees, Dinuguan ($8.95), the pork meat stew basted in pork blood and serrano chiles colloquially known as ""Chocolate Meat"". My wife found this to be ""tasty, but rich. A few bites is enough, more would be too much."" To my eyes it looked like chunky, dark chocolate pudding (hence the nickname), with a livery smell. Folks who like organ meats enjoyed it, but I can't say I'm a fan.

Finally dessert, beginning with Ube Halaya ($4.99), a cake of mashed ube root (purple yam) cooked with brown sugar, and condensed/evaporated milks. My wife and I agreed it's a pretty shade of purple, but it looks like Play-Doh® and doesn't taste much better. However, the Leche Flan ($4.99) was really outstanding. As with the Mexican variety, this custard is made of egg yolks and milk topped with caramel syrup, but we found Cafe de Manila's rendition to be superior in both flavor and texture. A perfect end to this gastronomic adventure.","*Sigh* I used to live very close to this Italian eatery that sits conveniently on the way to and from Eagle Creek State Park. And, I used to enjoy making any excuse to not cook and go here instead for a slice, a sandwich or a salad. eh!Formaggio's grub is particularly comforting in cool weather after a good workout.

I usually go for the antipasto salad or the vegetarian sandwich (that's probably my favorite item, actually), but I also enjoy a nice big, cheesy slice of the Neapolitan style pizza on occasion. And, I love the fact that this place has cannolis for dessert...I grew up eating cannolis like most kids eat donuts (dad's family is from Naples) and I am always excited when I find one on the menu.

1,"Was walking from a neighboring establishment on a drizzly Sunday that happened to be Mother's Day, and couldn't help but pop in and check it out. Man, am I glad we did! The place is brand new, open less then two weeks. We were promptly seated, and the head brewer (and his wife) both popped over to say hello and walk us through the offerings. We got two flights of the ciders, although the craft offerings and wine options were all local and impressive. I thought all four were really well done, and would happily revisit any of them. The flavors were clean, its obvious that the ingredients are carefully selected, and the finished product is pretty masterful. I thought the Hale to the Hop almost drank more like a beer, the citra hops were a lovely and unique choice. The Lil Sunshine was very drinkable and really delicious, and the Standard was excellent as expected. I could have used a little more mango with the Sail Away, but thats a very nitpicky, minor complaint. The physical space is beautiful and clean, and the place is exquisite because it still is shiny and brand new. We complimented our ciders with two pastries, sold in compliment with a neighboring business. A very nice touch! There was a menu of small plate food options that would be worth revisiting on the next trip through. Awesome new spot, thanks for a great time!","I love this place. Consistently friendly service, great apps, a wonderful salad bar that my wife, my mother and my mother-in-law all LOVE...and a GREAT steak. Every time. Its the highlight of a terrific menu and a great meal. Good prices. Terrific apps (although they got rid of the best part of the appetizer sampler, the Quesadilla eggrolls), terrific desserts...and one thing I will say about this place in particular is when something goes wrong, as things sometimes do, they make it right. My wife and I ordered our apps, got our salad, and ordered our meals. The meals came...no apps. But when we mentioned it to our server, who apologized profusely for forgetting, brought over a manager, and comped us our desserts. Well done. It would be great if no place ever made a mistake. I care far more when someone does and then can really make it right. We love this place, it's awesome.","Text1: Was walking from a neighboring establishment on a drizzly Sunday that happened to be Mother's Day, and couldn't help but pop in and check it out. Man, am I glad we did! The place is brand new, open less then two weeks. We were promptly seated, and the head brewer (and his wife) both popped over to say hello and walk us through the offerings. We got two flights of the ciders, although the craft offerings and wine options were all local and impressive. I thought all four were really well done, and would happily revisit any of them. The flavors were clean, its obvious that the ingredients are carefully selected, and the finished product is pretty masterful.

1,"Disappointing afghany restaurant in olde city. The Ariana kabob (chicken, beef, and lamb) was served on a large platter that was predominantly rice and a few small pieces of meat. The meat wasn't good. The service was very slow. Can't think of any reason to come back here.","Cool vibe, good food, great drinks, nice service. I was very skeptical of coming here b/c of it's 3.5 star rating and location in a hotel lobby, both of which we usually try to stay away from. But then my man Beef Cheeks threatened to end my existence so the 5 of us came here for dinner and sat at a long high table by the kitchen. We started off with the awesome hummus duo app which consisted of sweet pea hummus and artichoke hummus with pita and toasted breads and the fresh ricotta, citrus, and pickled beets salad. Loved the creativity of both hummus's. For entrees, we had the vegetable linguine and salmon with fennel and citrus. The salmon was outstanding. The linguine was decent but could have used a bit more flavor. Overall, very nice spot to come with a group or even on a date. My preconceived notion was way off.","Text1: Disappointing afghany restaurant in olde city.

1,"So, I have never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel because well I live here and who cares. However, I am rating the lobby because even a non corporate, simple, no frills gal like me must give pause to a hotel that has a river with boat tours in it's lobby. 

All the plants are live, fountains with colored back lights, lovely trails, koi ponds, make this a must visit place even for locals. I like to go in the winter when it's cold out and I need to see some green. It definitely lifts my mood. Of course they do a pretty spectacular Christmas presentation as well so if you are looking for an affordable Christmas experience, then just take the family for a stroll  through the lobby during December. We usually treat ourselves a festive holiday drink. 

Here is the trick to the parking. Opryland charges for parking but we park over at the mall and cut through cause I am cheap and the mall parking is free.","Jacksons is not my favorite restaurant but they seem to have managed to pull out that ""it's cool to be seen there""  vibe so people keep going back and they have a good drink menu. The outdoor seating is nice as well so I can see the appeal there. However the food is just ho hum as is the service. 

That being said, I have ordered several things on the menu and the only thing I have gotten that I like is the blackened Tuna sandwich. It's seasoned well and cooked rare so if you catch them on a good day, it's quite yummy. Otherwise, it's good. The cookie dough egg roll is disgustingly rich but you know I am surprised more people haven't thought of taking a roll of cooking dough, slathering it in breading, and deep frying it. 

Stick with the drinks and dessert but if you must have lunch, go with the tuna.  If you are there for breafast and can't stomach the pantry line, then hit Fido, their eggs are delisch..","Text1: So, I have never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel because well I live here and who cares.

0,"I am in need of a 399th review as the 400th review should be something special, and so, Fitlife Foods gets the final review before the big 4-0...0.

I've come here a few times, though I am not a member or a regular.  Usually, I'm here because I was lazy or forgot to go grocery shopping and Fitlife is infinitely better for you than going to any restaurant and obviously any fast food joint.

Essentially, its prepackaged meals-to-go, but fresh using local ingredients.  Step inside and you'll see a row of refrigerators along one wall with snacks on one end, breakfast on the other, and lunch/dinner options in all of the cases in between.  Food ranges from your standard American fare - burgers, scrambles, BBQ, etc - to some asian items like Korean beef or pad thai, and some Mexican items like enchiladas and tacos.  All meals come in 3 sizes based on what sort of plan you're on - body builders would probably want the large meals for the extra calories, and fatties like me need small or medium meals because I don't have room for one more roll in my torso!

Each meal has the calorie, carbs, protein and fat count right on the side of the box facing the door to the fridge, and nutritional content/ingredients on the bottom.

I mentioned membership, above.  I don't know if that's what it is, but I know they have programs and whatnot to help you fashion a diet that's right for you, and whenever I am in there, I hear the clerk mention a person's total charge after a discount, so I assume there's a plan or membership where you can get that.  However, I have only ever gone here for 1 or 2 meals and infrequently, so I cannot provide more info.

They have microwaves there, so if you want to heat up your meal before leaving, you can, and they have some condiments and plastic ware to help you out there, too.  Very convenient.

The food is very good.  Some meals are obviously better than others, but I think I have liked everything I have eaten.  The korean beef was among my favorites, but the breakfast scramble was very good, too, as was some pulled pork option that I don't recall.

I'm taking a star away for price, which is not something I would normally do because you should know the price going in.  However, I don't think its always worth the price.  It's great to use in a meal emergency or every now and then to fill in the gaps, but there are cheaper services out there that deliver to your home.  One comparison to make this point - today, I bought a small breakfast scramble and a medium lunch/dinner option and it cost almost $19.  On the other hand, earlier in the year, I was using a meal delivery service - NakedFit Foods - and 4 meals a day, 5 days a week, was $150, which works out to $7.50/meal.  Almost $2 a meal cheaper.  Now, $2 may not be much to you, but it adds up if this is your primary meal source, and the latter option delivers to your door every night.

Still, price notwithstanding, I am a fan of fitlife foods for a good, healthy, alternative to nearly every other option.  And in my case, where my stomach, my rear end, and my head are jostling for having the stronger gravitational pull, I could use some healthy alternatives in my life.","Let me tell you - this is my 2nd dealings with a Brake Masters in Tucson - and I will highly recommend this company to anybody looking for an honest place for car care.

I had received from a friend a gift certificate to BrakeMax which is located right across the street.  I brain-farted and accidentally dropped my car off at Brake Masters along with my gift certificate.

Guess what?  They honored my gift certificate!  They said that they hoped they would make me their customer - what a classy gesture.  Please see my other review for my first A+ run in with this beautiful company.

Expect extremely tasty baked goods that are worth the price.  The variety is also great.  Don't bother with street parking.  There is a great public parking lot across the street.,"We've been here 4 times and only get the beef burrito with cheese sauce AND green sauce, and the cheese chili relleno (it's not breaded...possibly the best I've had anywhere) with green sauce.

1,"I'm gonna miss this place.

I've been a member here for about a year and there were plenty of classes to keep me busy and lots of equipment so that I didn't have to wait to do the exercises that I wanted to do.  I'm sad that I'm leaving it because I've recently moved.  It is really nice and yes it is expensive but you got a lot with that membership.

They recently completed a complete overhaul to the men's showers which is cool.  It's not that they were bad before but I can see how they needed the upgrade.

I did spinning classes, boxing, circuit classes, pilates, swimming and general weight training.  I even tried yoga a couple of times which was awesome because it was in a private yoga studio, not a room with the lights dim.  The yoga studio was tranquil and even though I ended up hurting myself, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't think I'm the yoga type.

The website went a bit wonky from time to time when I tried to look at class schedules.  That's a minor complaint in my book.  I was able to take advantage of a special offer when I joined so I beat the initiation fee which is outrageous by the way.  Still, they offer specials and will let you train for a few days to see what you think of it.

I really liked working out here and I hope that a gym near my new place will be even half as good as the bellevue.  If it's convenient and you want to pay for it, you will enjoy it.","Shazam!

Wow I really liked this place.  I went out with some friends to catch the *LCS games and Prohibition Taproom was the selection.  I'm so happy we came here.

Very original bar layout.  When I first walked in my comment was, ""oh this place is small.""  Alas, I was incorrect!  It's not that I found another room, their bar juts out thus allowing for a more social setting while sitting at the bar.  Chairs are around each of these peninsulas which allows for extra seating.  Points for the cool bar layout although I'm sure it makes a little hell for the staff having to slide everything.  Maybe skip the soup :)

The green beans were delicious.  Garlic dipping sauce on the side and lighly battered and quickly fried.  Almost tempora style.  I got to taste the special burger (blue cheese, red wine reduction, arugula on ciabatta) and the special grilled cheese, I believe it was brie and figs.  I also tasted the mac and cheese which was made with shells and I don't think contained gruyere which I always thought was necessary in good mac and cheese.  It seems they might have proven me wrong!  The highlight was certainly the grilled cheese.  Brie and figs, cmon, how could that be bad?

Beer wise, I was very impressed with the selection.  I got the Hoppy Lil Buddy (or something like that) off the cask and it was very tasty.  Other members of my group drank the Left Hand Warrior and the Rt 113 IPA.  The draft list was printed in a weird font which made it tough to read in the dimly lit bar, but that's no biggie.

I wanna go back to this place already.  It was really really good.","Text1: I'm gonna miss this place.

And, if that wasn't enough, they offer TUITION reimbursement and a 401K. Why do I know this?

Word to the wise - this place packs up on the weekends and during dining under the stars, so make sure you make reservations!  I've also been told that there is an opera night that sounds pretty interesting, so I'd like to check that out sometime.

0,"Truly one of favorite places in all SB or Montecito. Sooo much better than Piatti was on its best day 

Tried the avocado and goat cheese sandwich which I never had (or any sandwich) because said it was on focaccia. 

This is a gross--but felicitous--misrepresentation

It's just a single piece of thick, fresh multi-grain bread piled high with golden (yellow) beets, an avocado puree (not sliced) and ample goat cheese. (Actually, maybe the goat cheese and avocado have been mixed). 

It comes with a side salad dressed with sherry vinaigrette I would almost think of trying to make myself. 

14 dollars. 

I will try the other sandwiches now that I know the bread is normal (and since it's open-faced), you're not eating that much bread anyway. You can sub fries for salad if you're not feeling virtuous. 

My new favorite sandwich!","When I was planning my previous wedding, I was looking for a wedding band to match my custom Tacori engagement ring. This thing was pricey, and we had decided not to put a real centre stone in it right away to save money for our honey moon. I went in to Michael Hill one day to scope out bands because I had never been in before. I was greeted immediately and asked if I needed anything. I explained what I was looking for, and she directed me to the appropriate areas. She complimented my ring, and asked if she could see it. I held up my hand, and she said it looked like it needed cleaning. I was aware, and she offered to do it. I was going to take it to my usual jeweler, Crowley's, but I figured why not? When she brought it back, it didn't look any cleaner, and she said, ""The side stones are very nice, but were you aware the centre is fake?"" I was appalled. Did she just take my ring to investigate my stones? I stiffly replied that yes, I knew, and that there was nothing there I liked, which was the truth. It's an average store, with another branch in WEM just like it. Not recommended.","Text1: Truly one of favorite places in all SB or Montecito. Sooo much better than Piatti was on its best day 

Tried the avocado and goat cheese sandwich which I never had (or any sandwich) because said it was on focaccia. 

This is a gross--but felicitous--misrepresentation

It's just a single piece of thick, fresh multi-grain bread piled high with golden (yellow) beets, an avocado puree (not sliced) and ample goat cheese. (Actually, maybe the goat cheese and avocado have been mixed). 

It comes with a side salad dressed with sherry vinaigrette I would almost think of trying to make myself. 

14 dollars. 

I will try the other sandwiches now that I know the bread is normal (and since it's open-faced), you're not eating that much bread anyway. You can sub fries for salad if you're not feeling virtuous. 

My new favorite sandwich!

1,Love their $5 specials!!!,"This place is just fantastic!  We used their catering service for a staff retreat recently and everyone just raved over the food.  The service was great, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty of it.  We had the barbecued ribs and chicken, baked beans, mac and cheese, potato salad and green salad.  It was all wonderful - my favorites were the ribs (slathered in their yummy hot honey sauce) and potato salad (some restaurants really screw up potato salad, but not Bridgeport Rib House).  

We stopped in for a (very ample) tasting a few months ago and that went very well too, which is why we decided to have them cater our event.  We got to sample pretty much everything (yay!) - it was all wonderful so it was pretty hard to decide which sides to get. Their sausage stuffing and macaroni salad were both delicious, as was everything else.

Bridgeport Rib House may be a ""biker bar,"" but they do a fabulous job and I hope to get up that way to eat again sometime.","Text1: Love their $5 specials!!!

MEAT
-live tilapia
- live crabs

Soups, salads, and sandwiches available for lunch. I had the mulligatawny and it was great! Tasty and healthy. I'll definitely become a regular here for lunch, and feel bad for not coming here sooner!","Fantastic new store! Huge and bright, and so much great stuff! There's a deli with freshly made meal options to go (lasagna, salads, sides, etc), gorgeous desserts, a meat department with meat already marinating, and so many more aisles filled with other food.  Bulk bins as well with lots of beans/lentils. They have frozen meat and fish, and the prices looked reasonable to me.

The produce section seemed kind of small when you take into account how big this store is, and the actually didn't have something I was looking for.

0,"Friendly service, games to play and food was ok. Fried Oysters were good, fries needed some seasoning. Flounder sandwich tasted ok, but came back later on me.
Music is pretty loud.","I was first introduced to El Camino when I met a group of friends there one evening. The food is exceptional for a bar, and I like the large open seating area and low lighting. There is also a bunch of outside seating, but I can't comment on it as I've never eaten outside here.

My favorite menu items here are the fried pickle chips (corn-meal batter gives it a really nice texture), the brisket sandwhich (on buttered texas toast/can sometimes be fatty), and the ribs! The ribs are done in a Texas style, great dry rub, smoked in-house, and no sauce. The bark on these suckers is delicious, smoky, and a little spicy, and the meat falls right off the bone. It was so good, I don't even remember if it came with a side, who cares? 

Also, if you are having a late weeknight, the margaritas are half-price on weekdays after 10PM. That's a pitcher (about 4 glasses) for 10 dollars. They are done in a traditional style, non-blended, and served on the rocks. Yum! I actually prefer them this way. You can get salt or sugar on your glass, but I like it straight up, nothing on the glass.

If you're going to visit El Camino I suggest a weekday as it seems to get very crowded on the weekends. I can't say for sure, but usually crowded places in this area get obnoxious really fast.","Text1: Friendly service, games to play and food was ok.

Their GF chocolate cupcake was good. The cupcake it's self was very moist.  The frosting was ok. To me the cupcake to icing ratio was off. There was too much icing for the amount of cupcake and it was a little bit to sweet for the chocolate.

I was told that their 56th street location has over 10-15 GF varieties of cupcakes, and I will definitely have to check this out.","Text1: *updated review* I fully anticipated bumping up my 3 star to 4 and understood much of the issues I experienced were due to the newness of the establishment.

Had dinner at a buffet for another meeting.  Typical Diner food with super service.","Came in for the western omelet with hash browns, however upon canvassing the lunch specials menu, i found a very hard to pass up chicken - fried steak with potatoes for $8.25. So I said, 'why the hell not'? So that, accompanied with green beans and a side salad came up to $9.27 after tax. Scoring a meal for under ten dollars anywhere these days is a rare occurrence for me.

Inside definitely feels like a diner, but I will say, things were smelling pretty good. Could have been that i was athirst for nourishment,  but the nose rarely confuses.

Got everything back to my house and it was all very good, I was rather pleased with the meal. These days, I'm not much into eating until I feel pot-belly-full; the portions were adequate of that desire as well. The chicken was not super crispy like most chicken-fried steaks, but I'll say that's the case because I drove it from St. Charles Ave to Mid City, still good tho. I also asked for white gravy and got brown, but it didn't kill the deal.

I think I'll be back for that western omelet tho. I'm glad I finally came here, I'll be seeing them soon.","Text1: Been here several times for meetings and had breakfast.   Good Diner breakfasts.

1,"Diamond in the rough. That's all that can be said about this chaat-catering, strangely delicious, unbelievably friendly environment. For the sake of full disclosure, my taste buds were certainly adjusting to chaat as I was at Mood. It's a strange sensation: the mixing of the hot veggies and meat, the cold yogurt, the crispy wonton shells - all of it crunched up in a bowl. 

Hasan, the owner and one of the friendliest faces in all of Philadelphia, explained every step of how he prepares and serves the food. Then, for dessert, he prepared a carrot and cream cheese dish, with hot, stewed carrots (naturally sweet) and homemade cheese. It was somehow similar to a pumpkin or sweet potato pastry. 

Like other reviewers's experience, I too was blown away by both Hasan's kindness and his restaurant. He remembers faces well, and will prepare you a different kind of dish every time you visit. He promised a different, hot rice and beans dish next time I came. He also assured my girlfriend and I that we would not have to pay if we didn't like the food. However, we loved the chaat and the dessert, and were more than happy to pay every cent (though he didn't charge us for the dessert). Can't wait to go back!","Mumbai knows what it's doing. It's going for wide appeal and succeeding. With vegan-friendly, buffet-style curry at $4.95/lb, you aren't going to hear any complaints from this guy. They avoid the potential pitfall of inadequate heating on the buffet line, and for an additional buck, you can add a side of naan. 

I have frequently pointed people in Mumbai's direction not only because of the food quality, but also because of the unbeatable prices. Not to be the eternal pessimist, but this is not the best Indian food in Philly. It's the best price, without question, and the service is always friendly; however, there are some other options worth considering if you want top-notch Tikka Masala and other Westernized curry dishes. 

Mumbai Bistro is definitely deserving of a 4-star review and while there may be nicer Indian restaurants in the city, few could compete with its accessibility.

0,"Mmmmmmmmm....

That is my first response to my Sunday brunch experience.  There were so many yummy things to choose from that we over ordered and took it home.

General Tso's wings.  Delicious.   Just the wasabi blue cheese sauce is enough to to give it a 4 star rating.

Blue Duck Fries - love the duck confit with the smoked Gouda cheese sauce.   It brings fries to a whole new stratum

Duck Benedict - eggs were a bit on the runny side but the sriracha Cherry hollandaise makes it fabulous.

Duck a l'orange- thin pancakes with duck and blood orange syrup.   This was good but not as good as the other things, but then I like thick pancakes.

Nonetheless I will be back to try other things on the menu.

The music here was very loud but the atmosphere rustic, though fresh and bright featuring a concrete floor that had been epoxied over and wooden tables.  Two large screen TVS dominate the space.  Tables are close.

Look out for the creepy mannequin in the back if you head back to the restroom.   Reservations are advisable.  Not the place to bring grandma.   More the spot for hipsters and empty nesters who still have their hearing","Amazing, great food at a really good price. The BBQ shrimp is as good as any restaurant in the city, regardless of price or reputation.

We had 2 BBQ shrimp dinners and 2 bowls of gumbo...Did I mention that the gumbo is excellent as well?

Many thanks to the owner, and great staff in making our meal the most memorable of our trip!","Text1: Mmmmmmmmm....

0,"I used to eat in at Bellacinos quite frequently. We always stuck with the pizza and it was pretty good.  After a hiatus I just got take-out recently - pizza, wings, and a grinder. The pizza was the greasiest pizza I've ever had. It was terrible. The box was soaked through and the crust had absorbed so much grease it was limp. And that's probably the last time I'll get pizza there.

The wings were ok. They offer hot, bbq, and teryaki (I think). They were very similar to Pizza Hut's wings. The grinder wasn't very good. It was the chicken, bacon, ranch and I could tell the chicken was the precooked, packaged stuff. Not like I expect them to make it fresh there, but still a turn-off.

My other problem is the restaurant always seems dirty. Even when there are hardly any customers in there, the tables are never wiped off and it just has a general dirty vibe. I think my Bellacino days are over.",We came here during the mardi gras celebrations. We made reservations which turned out to be a good idea. Kudos to the host and waitress for excellent service. After a long day of parades it helps to be able to sit down and have a good meal with great attentive dining experience. We had the oyster platter which was awesome. Dragos is good but this is just as good. We also has burgers and Abita beer. Great food. Will definitely come here again not because of the food but because we enjoyed having attentive service.,"Text1: I used to eat in at Bellacinos quite frequently.

1,"I love this park!

It is a great place to bring out of town visitors.  The eight mile loop is an amazing drive (or bike ride, or run depending on how brave you are).  In addition, there are a ton of trails.  You can get out and see everything.  

Do stop at the visitors center if you get a chance.  They are very helpful and there is a ton of information in their which always great for those new to the desert.  They have all the trail maps and you can buy a pass if you are so inclined.

Take plenty of water, and some snacks or a lunch and enjoy everything the landscape has to offer.

Be very careful of cyclists/runners when driving.  You shouldn't be in a hurry anyway as you should be enjoying the scenery.

I highly recommend this place to everyone!","Crap. I think I am living up to my tag line, ""I may be too nice for Yelp"". I think its because I spend too much time on here and only go to the places that give decent reviews.... but I digress. 

So, we showed up at about 615 with no reservation. We were seated right away. (And we didn't get the crappy table by the bar...woohoo!) The busboy came and offered an assortment of waters almost immediately. We decided to live on the edge and go with tap.. we were feeling crazy. 

Our waitress showed up promptly thereafter and asked us if we had any questions, explained the specials, and whether we were needing to be finished in time for anything (apparently a lot of theater goers come in before the show...). We were not in any hurry. My hubby ordered a mixed beer that wasn't on the signature drink list, but since he saw they had the ingredients for, requested. It came out great. My wine was good. 

So, you know when you go somewhere that has dishes you don't see in many other places... and you know you should try them... but then don't, well yeah. I feel bad reviewing the food based on what we ordered, but I will do it anyway. We seriously ordered a salad to split (which if the kitchen splits it for you there is an upcharge, but I am lazy and don't care) , I ordered one of the pizzas, and hubby ordered the burger. It was the mood we were in, deal with it. 

We got the Bibb salad. The figs and hazelnuts were good and the lettuce crisp. The first bite of the vinaigrette was a little tart. But then it smoothed out. I had the roasted garlic, mushroom, arugula, goat cheese pizza. MMMM. It was really good. But with simple ingredients I really do expect nothing less. 

My hubby's burger was huge. But it came out cooked perfectly. He added the Gruyere and mushrooms. I did taste it, and it was a very tasty burger. Again, with something somewhat simple like that, I expect it not to be screwed up. And surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fries. They were thin, but not quite shoestring? I dunno. But they were good. 

Overall, our service was prompt and everyone was friendly. Our waitress was good. The food was good. I definitely dig the atmosphere. 

Yep... I will go back... with every intention of trying something a little more complicated than a burger and pizza.","Text1: I love this park!

It is a great place to bring out of town visitors.  The eight mile loop is an amazing drive (or bike ride, or run depending on how brave you are).  In addition, there are a ton of trails.  You can get out and see everything.  

Do stop at the visitors center if you get a chance.  They are very helpful and there is a ton of information in their which always great for those new to the desert.  They have all the trail maps and you can buy a pass if you are so inclined.

Take plenty of water, and some snacks or a lunch and enjoy everything the landscape has to offer.

Be very careful of cyclists/runners when driving.  You shouldn't be in a hurry anyway as you should be enjoying the scenery.

I highly recommend this place to everyone! 

 Text2: Crap. I think I am living up to my tag line, ""I may be too nice for Yelp"". I think its because I spend too much time on here and only go to the places that give decent reviews.... but I digress. 

So, we showed up at about 615 with no reservation. We were seated right away. (And we didn't get the crappy table by the bar...woohoo!) The busboy came and offered an assortment of waters almost immediately. We decided to live on the edge and go with tap.. we were feeling crazy. 

Our waitress showed up promptly thereafter and asked us if we had any questions, explained the specials, and whether we were needing to be finished in time for anything (apparently a lot of theater goers come in before the show...). We were not in any hurry. My hubby ordered a mixed beer that wasn't on the signature drink list, but since he saw they had the ingredients for, requested. It came out great. My wine was good. 

So, you know when you go somewhere that has dishes you don't see in many other places... and you know you should try them... but then don't, well yeah. I feel bad reviewing the food based on what we ordered, but I will do it anyway. We seriously ordered a salad to split (which if the kitchen splits it for you there is an upcharge, but I am lazy and don't care) , I ordered one of the pizzas, and hubby ordered the burger. It was the mood we were in, deal with it. 

We got the Bibb salad. The figs and hazelnuts were good and the lettuce crisp. The first bite of the vinaigrette was a little tart. But then it smoothed out. I had the roasted garlic, mushroom, arugula, goat cheese pizza. MMMM. It was really good. But with simple ingredients I really do expect nothing less. 

My hubby's burger was huge. But it came out cooked perfectly. He added the Gruyere and mushrooms. I did taste it, and it was a very tasty burger. Again, with something somewhat simple like that, I expect it not to be screwed up. And surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fries. They were thin, but not quite shoestring? I dunno.

caveat: smoking is allowed.","I've been here a handful of times now and each time has been fun for the most part, with our most recent visit being the most awesome night ever! This place is huge!

The slots are fun, I enjoy the video slots the most. The interactivity is fun. Some of the slots are confusing (I have no idea what I'm doing! I just push a button!) The losing and winning back and forth can keep you there for a while. You keep playing in hopes of hitting the jackpot LOL. I can see how people can get addicted. I've been lucky enough to win a nice chunk of change a couple of times. And thankfully, I know when to stop myself! I haven't played at any of the tables yet, I've never seen any low minimum tables- not sure if they have those here?

The staff at the casino in all of my encounters have been friendly, professional and helpful. We had an awesome time inside the Hard Rock Cafe for a private event!

1,"Location opened mid-May 2014, just a 1 minute drive east from I-65 exit 130.

Everything is nice and new, bright and clean. No real surprises in store layout or product offerings - it's all as you expect. Pharmacy. Lots of parking. Self checkout isles near BOTH main entry doors.

Hippie factor: Baby organic dry goods section is fantastic with many options. Organic frozen foods, however, continue to be lacking when compared to Kroger ...no real surprise there but I was hoping to be wowed.

Certainly will feel more comfortable sending the wife and kid here instead of the Meijer at Lafayette Rd.","The cannoli with ricotta + chocolate chips, WOW. Every bit as good as what we had in Italy ...seriously PERFECT. Sweet, crispy, creamy. Seemed expensive at the counter but after taking just one bite, it was immediately apparent that it was worth every penny and then some.  Amazing, amazing.

If you only have time to eat one dessert in Philly, you had better make it a cannoli at Termini Bros!","Text1: Location opened mid-May 2014, just a 1 minute drive east from I-65 exit 130.

1,"Back on my taco binge, I had to find a new place to get my fixing. I like this little place, a lot. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.

There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.

Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.

My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.

The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.

One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in ""the book"" and they would take care of it next time. Well folks, there is no ""the book"" so if it happens to you, don't fall for it. Get something written from management.

****UPDATE****
My date clarified that there IS in fact a book. My Apologies to any staff affected.
11/10/2015","Came in for the western omelet with hash browns, however upon canvassing the lunch specials menu, i found a very hard to pass up chicken - fried steak with potatoes for $8.25. So I said, 'why the hell not'? So that, accompanied with green beans and a side salad came up to $9.27 after tax. Scoring a meal for under ten dollars anywhere these days is a rare occurrence for me.

Inside definitely feels like a diner, but I will say, things were smelling pretty good. Could have been that i was athirst for nourishment,  but the nose rarely confuses.

Got everything back to my house and it was all very good, I was rather pleased with the meal. These days, I'm not much into eating until I feel pot-belly-full; the portions were adequate of that desire as well. The chicken was not super crispy like most chicken-fried steaks, but I'll say that's the case because I drove it from St. Charles Ave to Mid City, still good tho.

I don't have pets groomed there but I once called for pricing on having my cat boarded and the rates were a bit high but mostly comparable to other boarding options. My main complaint is this: every single time I visit this store, there is a lengthy check-out line because they only have one cashier working. I'm sure there are times that they have two or more cash registers going at once but I've never witnessed it and I've been at least 6 times this year at different time of day.","Went to El Camino for brunch this weekend. It was not as good as my dinner was previously.

The huevos rancheros was served in a cast iron skillet, which is cool, but it really wasn't doing it for me. It kind of tasted bland and the refried beans were more like a soup than they were like a refried bean. Also, the breakfast burrito doesn't come with any type of sauce like guac or sour cream, and I think that's just weird.

Our waitress, while very pretty (Megan Fox look-alike), was pretty checked out. She didn't come over to check on us and only refilled our water glasses after my friend had to start drinking out of my glass. She also didn't ask if I wanted a refill of my coffee. When my friend asked for ketchup she brought the bottle to our table and slid it across the table. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty rude.

I'll stick with Green Eggs or Cantina Dos Segundos for breakfast now on.","Text1: This Petsmart is pretty alright. It's usually pretty clean and relatively well-stocked.

But most of the time, I just want to choose food that tastes good from a menu with reasonable variety and prices. Marathon is my go-to spot for that kind of meal - especially for brunch!

1,"This is probably one of my most fav places to go play games back in college.   Tho I'm more an adult now (lol), I still enjoy the arcade.  It has gotten pricier than I remembered.  We no longer get tickets cause everything is now put onto the players card.  The games are newer and it looks great in here. But the food is not something I would come to D&B for.  We were hungry after the game at the superdome and decided to eat here instead of at the stadium.  We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and steak pasta for me and ribs/chicken wing combo. Let's dive in. 
The pasta dish was super bland.  I had to add salt to it.  Normally I don't even like to add salt to anything ever.  The pasta was soft. The steak medallions were slightly over cooked and the bacon was tasty.  I love the added spinach with my pasta topped with fried spinach.  I miss the blackened chicken pasta! For dessert, we had the Bookie. 

My husband said his ribs were tough to eat and the buffalo wings were too salty.  It's as if the buffalo wings just came out of the oven.  They use bottled ranch instead of making their own.  The fries were soggy as well.  

The Bookie tower for dessert was ok.  They did break the tower down so we can share.  One brownie/cookie topped with a bluebell vanilla scoop of ice cream. You can tell that they had just microwaved a frozen Bookie.  It was hard to eat after a few mins. 

But our server was sweet and provided excellent service. She checked on us constantly as she walked by. Overall we would come back for the games but not for food.","Finally! I've been waiting for this place to open and it finally is!  This restaurant is clean    Inside.  Beverages served are beer and soda and of course, Cafe Sua Da. Which is coffee with condense milk and ice.  It's your vietnamese coffee! I am sadden that they don't prepare it the traditional way but rather, the coffee is made ahead of time.  I can understand and appreciate the time constraints since everyone is in a hurry these days.  

We had ordered three dishes. Pho Dac Biet ( basically special pho), combination broken rice dish and chicken wings.  We receive  everything at the same time, tho I did want the wings as appetizer. 

The wings were fried then sautéed in jalepenos and onions. It wasn't flavorful. There was a bowl of sauce for dipping which did make the wings tastier. So I did what any normal person would do...I poured the sauce over the wings! Delicious! 

My pho Dac Biet was about 12.99 a bowl. It had brisket , eye round and meatballs.  A bit pricy for not a flavorful dish. I went somewhere else yesterday and paid the same price but that dish had oxtail and was flavorful! 

My hubby got the combination rice dish. It came with grilled shrimp, sautéed pork slices and grilled chicken.  The sweet and sour fish sauce is a must. The chicken was dry. Shrimp was tender and flavorful. The pork was ok. It wasn't special or had special flavor that I would want to eat again.  Btw it costs $2 extra for a fried egg. Most places charge $1 extra.  We had to forgo the egg this time. 

Overall, it's a decent place to get your vietnamese fix. It's roomy and servers are really nice.

But our server was sweet and provided excellent service. She checked on us constantly as she walked by. Overall we would come back for the games but not for food. 

 Text2: Finally! I've been waiting for this place to open and it finally is!  This restaurant is clean    Inside.  Beverages served are beer and soda and of course, Cafe Sua Da. Which is coffee with condense milk and ice.  It's your vietnamese coffee! I am sadden that they don't prepare it the traditional way but rather, the coffee is made ahead of time.  I can understand and appreciate the time constraints since everyone is in a hurry these days.  

We had ordered three dishes. Pho Dac Biet ( basically special pho), combination broken rice dish and chicken wings.  We receive  everything at the same time, tho I did want the wings as appetizer. 

The wings were fried then sautéed in jalepenos and onions. It wasn't flavorful. There was a bowl of sauce for dipping which did make the wings tastier. So I did what any normal person would do...I poured the sauce over the wings! Delicious! 

My pho Dac Biet was about 12.99 a bowl. It had brisket , eye round and meatballs.  A bit pricy for not a flavorful dish. I went somewhere else yesterday and paid the same price but that dish had oxtail and was flavorful! 

My hubby got the combination rice dish. It came with grilled shrimp, sautéed pork slices and grilled chicken.  The sweet and sour fish sauce is a must. The chicken was dry. Shrimp was tender and flavorful. The pork was ok. It wasn't special or had special flavor that I would want to eat again.  Btw it costs $2 extra for a fried egg. Most places charge $1 extra.  We had to forgo the egg this time. 

Overall, it's a decent place to get your vietnamese fix. It's roomy and servers are really nice.

I would like to try their crawfish during crawfish season!",yes
0,Took advantage of the free doughnut coupon from Krispy Kreme ...so with all the signage and hype for the pumpkin flavored fall doughnuts.. I chose the Pumpkin Cheesecake... and it was very very good.... especially the FREE part,"About six years ago a group of graphic artists set to the task of creating images that captured the essence of Nashville. Now you can find these lovely prints in the forms of magnets, books, posters, and just about whatever else you can think of. 

The line includes about every site you can think of in town from the Zoo and the Bluebird Cafe, to the Opera, and the Symphony. They're so beautifully designed, they're for those of us who live here and not just for visitors looking for a standard postcard. These are prints that you can frame and hang and they will look beautiful and have the personal Nashville touch. So far I've only bought the giraffe magnet, but there are quite a few more I'd like to have.

You can go to the actual store at the place where they were designed, or you can go to places like Davis-Kidd and Borders to find a smaller selection of products. 

I think it's great to have art work that reflects such a cool town.","Text1: Took advantage of the free doughnut coupon from Krispy Kreme ...so with all the signage and hype for the pumpkin flavored fall doughnuts..

I recently went with some friends here for weekday lunch. We had a nice table by the front window overlooking St. Charles. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. 

I had the Almond Chicken Salad. It was a huge plate of food! Seemed like enough for 2-3 meals. Two of my friends ordered the Fried Chicken with Red Beans, which was excellent. Our fourth friend got the Honey Island Chicken Sandwich. It looked huge! 

I haven't been disappointed yet with anything I've ordered from here. I look forward to going back soon.","They do have good pancakes and waffles.

1,"The best gelato place in the city. I've been to almost all their locations and each times have had friendly, efficient service. The one in University City especially blew my mind with their freakishly clean bathrooms. Total plus in the city!

I'm kinda bummed they got rid of the cream cheese flavor; that was one of my favorites. Others that top my list are Nutella, fior di latte, straciatella, hazelnut, and macadamia nut. Combine the macadamia nut with milk chocolate and it's like a Hawaiian Host! 

One gripe: it does get a little pricey, so my husband and I usually split a medium-sized one.","Pretty good, pretty good! I've heard fairly bad reviews about the location near Jefferson, but this place seemed to have a lot of people, so my husband and I took a chance and ate there.

We ordered the calamari for our appetizer. I wasn't too impressed, as there was a lot of breading than actual calamari. The sauce was good though (can't remember what it was).

My entree was the chicken marsala with parmesan risotto and grilled asparagus. Very yummy! I liked the risotto because it felt like I was eating chicken and rice. =) I wish there were more veggies though.

Overall, I'd come back. Prices are decent, service was good, and it's close to our apartment.","Text1: The best gelato place in the city.

0,Just left this awesome place & can't say enough about the helpfulness & fun the staff is.  Wish I had time to hang out & try some varying vape juice.....next time.  Keep up the great a job that you guys do.  Anxious to try the new flavor you were working on (yummy),"The Studio has a ton to offer - Yoga, massages, Zumba classes, a Juice bar, and other events (such as seminars).
The place is located above the Spy Shop on Virginia St.  Their entire schedule is posted online and if you are a member they will send you an email with the schedule and upcoming events.  The only thing I've been annoyed with regarding their schedule is that classes will be cancelled and the only way to know is to check the website.  So I've shown up only to have to turn right back around because there is no class that week.  It would be great if they had an email notification that gets sent out for those classes (but only the classes that you cared about).
I take Zumba on Saturday mornings and it is a TON of fun and such a great workout.  Amy is a fantastic instructor and will offer to help you after class with moves that you don't quite understand.  The class is always small (3 people is the smallest I've seen it and 6 was the biggest) so you don't bump into other people too much.  The room that Zumba is in is the same room that has Hot Yoga, so it was getting pretty hot there for a while, but luckily in the last couple of weeks they opened up the vents for the air conditioner.
An unlimited membership (first month only) will cost you $40.  Not worth it to me since Zumba was really the only class that fits my schedule.  Drop-ins are $12 (even though their website says $10).  A 5 class pass is $50 and a 10 class pass is $90.  I would stick with the class passes since, after your first month, membership is $69.

1,"Is it true?  A great place to eat sushi in the Northwest?  No way!  Yes, yes way.  And of course I discover it the same week I get an offer on my home in Northwest Reno.

So, here is the skinny.

This place is actually surprisingly good.  The service was AWESOME!!  I had a party of 12 show up and they bent over backwards to take care of us.  Special requests were taken care of promptly.  Friendly as heck too.

Atmosphere is pretty standard Reno AYCE sushi.  Think Sushi Time or Sushi Pier.  It's not a fancy ""date"" place.  The roll presentation isn't all ""ooh ah"" so if you eat more with your eyes than with your mouth.  You may be disappointed.

However the food was really good.  The flavors were full and the rolls seemed to actually taste different between each roll.  You know how many times you go to a place and it just seems to be the same roll with the same sauce with different names...this wasn't the case here.

One roll I really liked was the ""red"" roll.  Just wows I tell ya.  Wows!

I will be going back, even though I don't live up there anymore...I will be going back.  With friends.  And you should too.

Coke products.","This review is for the bar area only.  

This one is a tough review.  On one hand the service we got was rough.  They seemed to be a man down for a while and it really showed, but on the otherhand, when our waiter arrived he was really cool, helpful and took GREAT care of us.

Then the food had two hands too.  On one the food was decent, and nothing to really complain about, standard bar fare with a really tasty item called the chingalinga I think.  But on the otherhand it was 'merkinized mexican bar food.  One thing we for sure will get next time will be the grilled chicken nachos instead of the shredded chicken.  Just too bland.

The drinks also had some duality.  We had two of the special drinks and those were really good.  But my standard bloody mary was so lame that the waiter took it on himself to make me one with much more flavor.  I know, I know bloody mary requests at a Cantina?  

The atmosphere in the bar is actually nice and open when we went.  It seems lots of the Victorian bars have this same vibe.  

And thankfully the prices during happy hour were really good.  So good I think the next time I am looking for a friendly place to have a few drinks with people in Sparks, I will scoot on down for their happy hour for sure.

Parking may be a little tight during busy times, but when we went, parking was right out front and plentiful across the street.","Text1: Is it true?  A great place to eat sushi in the Northwest?

0,"Back on my taco binge, I had to find a new place to get my fixing. I like this little place, a lot. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.

There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.

Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.

My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.

The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.

One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in ""the book"" and they would take care of it next time. Well folks, there is no ""the book"" so if it happens to you, don't fall for it. Get something written from management.

My date clarified that there IS in fact a book. My Apologies to any staff affected.
11/10/2015","It pains me to write this review since the previous dozen or so times I'my boyfriend and I have been to Tzin for date nights, it was always enjoyable, cozy and the servers really made us feel special, however, this past weekend, my boyfriend and I had our least favourite dining experience there and that really made us both question if we want to return in the near future. 

It's true when they say customer service either makes or breaks an experience. When we first started going to Tzin about two years ago, we were blessed with two excellent servers - Kerrie & Mel... they alone made us want to come back because they made us laugh and were so enthusiastic about the experience and the food. However, about a year ago, Mel left to pursue other endeavours, but we were left in the capable hands of Kerrie (who is also the owner). She has always been friendly, sweet and super pleasant. Re-hired was a former male server from the past. The last few times we've dined there we luckily had Kerrie has our server so my boyfriend and I were happy about that. However, this past Saturday, upon arrival, we were surprised to see that Kerrie was not there, and instead, there was the regular male server from previous times plus another gentleman serving the room. We were greeted promptly and asked if we had reservations (which we did). There were two free tables, for two, at the time - one right near the entrance, and the other in the middle of the room. He immediately pointed to the table right near the entrance for us to sit. We obviously preferred to sit closer inside since it was -30 outside and there isn't much of a barrier between the outside door and inside. I therefore had to ask if we could sit at the other table instead. Instead of agreeing to it, we had to wait until the server asked the other gentleman for permission (which I thought weird since they were both tables for 2). Anyways, that's fine. We got our table in the middle and were seated promptly but missing a menu until my boyfriend had to ask for me. It's around this point that I really started feeling like this date night wasn't going to be the same as others and my boyfriend said he was just thinking the same thing. The server wasn't warm and genuine in his greeting, didn't even ask how we were doing, just wanted to see if we were ready to make our order. Throughout the night, I noticed the same lack of personal attentiveness - for instance, in the past with the girls, usually when the dish is placed on the table, it is described in delicious detail - this time nothing was described except for the three different sauces accompanying the chorizo. Also, our server never once checked up on us after the first few bites, to see how our food was. Incidentally, we ordered three of our favourite dishes and they are all usually very good, but this time round, the potato bravas was seriously lacking in depth - a certain smokiness that we've tasted in the past was not there and all the flavours felt disconjointed like they didn't have time to meld together. The bacon and the chorizo we ordered were very good. All-in-all, my boyfriend and I commented on how cold and inpersonal it felt, even though the space is small and warm. We actually finished our food and drink, didn't linger to have dessert like usual, because that's how disappointed we were with the night's experience. In fact, our date lasted a grand total of 1 hour from start to finish. So much for a lovely evening out.

Please note, the price for food here is a steep, albeit good, compared to the portion sizes. For instance, we ordered the ""potato bravas"" which was $14.50 for literally two small handfuls of chopped potatoes with bits of bacon, covered in a tomato sauce and topped with green onion. The ""bacon"" dish  was $16 for 3 bite-size pieces of pork belly on crostini. And the ""grilled chorizo sausage"" was $15 for maybe a 20 cm long piece of sausage.","Text1: Back on my taco binge, I had to find a new place to get my fixing. I like this little place, a lot. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.

There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.

Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.

My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.

The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.

One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in ""the book"" and they would take care of it next time.

1,"So...how do i update my review calmly? Well, as far as the food goes...it was really good (better than my previous experience). I ordered a pound of pork to go as well as a side of beans, but first I wanted to make sure they were gluten free. Everyone looked at each other like errrrr...??? Then someone shouted from the back of the kitchen (you can see straight through when you order) ""WELL, IT DOESN'T HAVE BREAD IT IN."" Really? No sh!t smartass. Someone actually asked about them and i was finally told they were safe. Sorry to be such an inconvenience!  I may be back for the food, but that's twice now I've experienced not so great service. Here's a tip: don't treat your customers like they are dumbsh!ts. I've worked in the food service industry; at least wait til i walk away to be sarcastic.","Well i'm still searching for good bbq in nashville. After 7 seven years here, I'm getting a bit weary that I won't find some. I had the bbq pork sandwich, no bun and a side of fries. LOVED the fries but the bbq pork was just ok. My fiance had the Tuck special and i had a few bites. It was SO good! I do recommend it. Jackalope Rompo Red was on tap- thank goodness! I'm willing to give it another try maybe some BBQ nachos or the pork/brisket platter!

0,"The first thing you'll notice when you walk into the restaurant is how tiny the space is. There are 30 seats in the restaurant and an additional 12 at the bar, but the seating is creatively arranged to allow guests and servers to move through the restaurant with ease. The decor is an odd juxtaposition of rustic meets modern. You notice the variety of whiskey bottles on the shelves behind the bar and immediately acknowledge that you're in a Southern-style restaurant. Service moves at a slow, steady pace. The first of our dishes arrives, a bed of mustard greens tossed with benne seeds and peanuts. The dressing is fiery hot and spicy good! Spicy without being unbearable, the dressing accents the nuts and greens nicely. What a crazy flavor combination! The shrimp and grits were utter perfection. Big, juicy, grilled shrimp sitting on top of a small helping of creamy, buttery grits with diced pieces of country ham strewn for good measure. Who would think grits could be this good? The buttermilk coated fried oyster slider with its burst of flavor in the middle was just sooo good! Move over crabcake and filet sliders, this oyster slider has found a place in my heart! The blackened catfish was one of the best pieces of catfish I've ever eaten. It was firm like rockfish, but didn't have that characteristic catfish taste or odor. The Carolina gold rice is one of the best accompaniments I've ordered in a while. It pairs really well with the hot chicken, which is OH. MY. GOD. everything that the hype says it is. It is indeed fiery hot, as in spicy hot. It is indeed crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. My friend Chris W and I were ready, willing, and able to dive right into the alleged chicken that saw fit to win the heart of local food critic, Craig Laban. In our two orders, our server stated how fortunate we were to have one dish with white meat and one dish with dark meat. Without hesitation, I went for the dark meat. I tasted a small sample of the breast meat on Chris's plate and it, too, was juicy good. Almost too good. Was there crack in the chicken? The pecan pie was a delicious ending to a fantastic meal. You can't ask for a better meal anywhere. I felt like I was at Morimoto or Vetri. For this reason, I can honestly give The Fat Ham my highest rating.","On a dreary, dank, pollen-ridden spring day in New Orleans, a new coffee Mecca was born. Polished and poised, eager staff made a delicious pour over from a boutique roaster.

There's pastries and lunch items to come, but I was really there for the magic elixir that stirs my heart and hastens my thoughts. I wasn't disappointed. Can't wait

1,"I've been dying to try Federal Donuts since they first opened their flagship location. So a few weekends back when we happened to be in the neighborhood, we finally had our chance! 

We walked into the small storefront and were greeted by a warm smile behind the counter. We settled on a half order of the buttermilk ranch chicken and six chili garlic style wings (which we were told were excellent choices btw.) The lovely lady behind the counter told us she'd cut us a break and just charge us for the whole chicken instead of two halves to save a buck. 

Then of course, we needed to decide on donuts. Lots of their specialty donuts were sold-out so we stuck with the classics. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and Bry went with the Apollonia Spice, then as if our day couldn't get any better, the sweet lady behind the counter told us she would throw in the Vanilla Lavendar for free, just so we could try it! Bam! They just earned themselves a lifelong customer. The inside of the store is minimalist and charming, there are about six seats at the counter so if there is an open spot, snatch it up quick!

The buttermilk ranch was my absolute favorite. I loved the flavor and crispiness of the outside and the chicken was crazy moist on the inside. I've had dreams about it every night since I first got my hands on it. 

Please note: and we were newbies so we had no idea, with every order of chicken you get a tasty honey lemon donut to go along (pictured below.) It's really the perfect compliment to the chicken -- a little savory and a little sweet. If I had known that we might not have ordered three other donuts, but heck, you live and you learn.","Quick follow up to my previous review. The Churchill burger is ridiculous, the brussels sprouts are out of this world, and the bone marrow appetizer makes me want to cut off my own leg. That is all.

1,Lovely landmark that is significant to Alton! I remember as a child coming here and recently came back to check it out. Looks a lot nicer and very clean. It's currently under construction. No trials or hiking area. J,"Oh Momo's where to start....this was my first time here. My siblings many times here. Service was not as great as expected. We saw our server a couple times. Others had brought our food out. I would rate this establishment as a 2.5 if that was an option. 

What we ordered...

Roasted Red Pepper Hummus: absolutely delicious! The best hummus I've had in awhile! The bread was nice and warm. Downfall, they should provide more pita. 

Grilled octopus: first bite was good. Second bite wasn't so sure. Third bite...I just wanted to throw up. I love octopus but and this was something different....perhaps spoiled octopus? The only dish that just sat there because no one could eat it. 

Bacon Phyllo: I love phyllo in general, the people in my party do too! The description is BACON phyllo...and non of us were able to taste the bacon at all!

Lobster Mac n Cheese: we all enjoy this dish! Way super creamy and cheesy with chunks of lobster! Yum! For the dish we expected the noodles to be a little softer for Mac n cheese style. 

Traditional Gyro: this gyro was absolutely delicious! We all enjoyed this very much! A matter of fact it we killed this dish before all other food lol. The meat is very flavorful. And all the veggies and tzatiki were superb! 

Overall, some food was good, some was ehh. What bothered me the most was that there's a trash can right next to the soda machine with ice. The ice was not covered. The trash was next to it. I saw employees throw trash in it and some bounced off into the ice. Yuck! And very unsanitary.","Text1: Lovely landmark that is significant to Alton!

I was really taken aback by how nice the hostess and the waitress were. They were genuinely very friendly and even laughed convincingly at my usual offering of lame jokes. 

The restaurant is a BYO and we brought a bottle of wine, which they promptly uncorked and put on ice. 

Their menu has a heat/spiciness scale that goes up to 4 peppers. I got the drunken noodles (marked as 3 peppers) and asked if they could make them ""at least a 4."" They were happy to oblige and I found the heat level to be perfect. The spring rolls were also very good.

They had a modest sale going on and the pair of shoes i ended up with was $5 off and there was a Yelp coupon offering $10 off a $50 or more purchase.

I wandered in here tonight after getting lost and very, very wet. I stood at the hostess/Please wait to be seated table and no one bothered to make eye contact with me or acknowledged me. Went to the bathroom and came back. Again no acknowledgement until the bartender asked if I needed to be seated. I had the choice of a small table sanwiched right in the middle of a bunch of tables or the bar. I chose the bar.

I ordered a Paulaner and the Copa burger with Spanish fries. The Paulaner came pretty fast and was pretty tasty. It's always nice when you find a place that cleans their taplines. Too many places around here don't. The Copa burger and fries came out after a bit. The fries were smokin' hot so I ate a good portion of the burger first. The Copa burger comes with mild green chiles, Monterey Jack,  and bacon on it. The chiles were decent, as was the cheese and bacon. Unfortunately my burger, which I ordered medium well to hopefully get medium, was more like medium rare. Lots of pink and juices. I like a little juice but not that much. The fries were decent but I'm not sure they were ""award winning"". And how serving fries with little green chiles and fried onions counts as being Spanish, I don't know.

The service was ok, but not that great. It took a long time to get a second beer. It seemed like they were understaffed for how many people were there. That and/or I was getting ignored. 

I might come back again and see if this was just an off night.

The potatoes just a little different, the juice Is freshly squeezed, the bacon just a little thicker than usual, the strawberry jam more flavorful than most...Is it OK to eat breakfast twice because I want more now. 

Friendly staff, good prices and quick service...breakfast nirvana!","Text1: 2.5 stars.

1,"I find it difficult to rate a chain, but this location is one of the closest to me, although not much a coffee drinker, I do visit more than the others.  I have never had a poor beverage from this location, and recently they started serving limited gluten free treats.  I spotted a wrapped 2pk of chocolate cookies in the case yesterday. The USA menu is coming up here, just slower than molasses.

They upgraded a while back and added power outlets. Handy in a pinch!

Yes, I definitely come back. And you should get a Starbucks card and the app for the perks. So easy to pay from my phone if I forget my wallet - heck even if I have my card or wallet. Gold stars! Earn beverage upgrades, and freebies. Nothing wrong with that.","#glutenfree available! And boy is it good! If it's not already gluten-free, they'll make it if they can!

The fryer is shared, so not gluten-free but if you can tolerate it, the fries are spicy and yumm I'm told.

Super smoked bacon yum!  Local meats... and they turn them into the best deli meats! What a selection! 

There's so many great items on a right-sized menu. Man when that bacon starts cooking it's hard to concentrate on the menu! 

I've ordered the basic, Broke Back Breakfast, the double bacon sandwich, and most recently The Cobb. Being out of smoked turkey, we substituted ham, and as I'm not a fan of feta cheese, substituted smoky Sylvan Star (local) Gouda. Oh man that was a fantastic modification!

Meat boards... look fabulous with in-house made condiments, there is Alberta beer on tap, wine, and CIDER! An excellent cider... Broken Ladder from BC Tree fruits. 

Home made Bacon caramels... well, when they're in stock you do have to try them!!

Yes, there is guest wifi! Password is on the wall above the prep kitchen door, next to the Bull head. 

I do miss the guys on the truck, but having longer hours, larger menu is an excellent trade. :-D","Text1: I find it difficult to rate a chain, but this location is one of the closest to me, although not much a coffee drinker, I do visit more than the others.

0,"I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated. I hadn't been back here for a while and it continues to serve great pies.  The renovated entrance has improved the congestion at door.

This trip we tried the Blanca, which was a  nice change from tomatoes and meats, but the appeal wore off after a slice or two.  This would be great one to share with a group, so everyone can try something different. The Siciliana was absolutely perfect -- the sauce is divine and that thin, quick baked crust is how all pizza should be.

My only gripe with this chain is the poor quality of the Parmesan cheese. I just don't understand why they offer that awful, powdery stuff to put on such a quality pie.","You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry, tiring wait to get a seat. 

We tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave.

The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. 

Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos. If I come back with a smaller party, that is what I would get.","Text1: I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated.

On my third visit, I ordered a peanut butter shake, the whiskey BBQ burger medium rare, and small fries with Sriracha ketchup.

The shake was good.

The burger came out almost WELL DONE FOR THE THIRD VISIT IN A ROW, and the meat tasted off--almost kind of rotten. Way too greasy too.

My friend and I also almost didn't get our fries until I flagged down a waitress to ask about them. Could not really taste the Sriracha in my Sriracha ketchup, if that's what was brought out. :\","Text1: Lots of cool stuff here and employees that are eager to help you find what you're looking for, even if you don't know what that is walking into the store.

0,"A solid bubble tea place.  For Indy, pretty top notch.  Awesome that they have popping boba and let you try the flavors first.  But if you get a milk tea, you get powdered flavor, not fresh fruit or juice.  Not sure if the smoothie is the same way.  Powdered flavor is not awful, but it doesn't hold a candle to the fresh fruit boba teas from Chicago.  

The décor is trendy and modern.  Several comfy couches and giant TVs.  We got ours to go, but this would be a cool place to hang.  Free wifi!","I have given good reviews to Maher in the past, and generally have had good experiences. However, they always gave out free rental vehicles while getting and oil change and this perk was one of the reasons I held such a high opinion of Maher Chevrolet. I learned a couple mornings ago, that is no longer the case. Without that perk, I am seriously disappointed, but I realize this was a rather rare perk for a Chevy Dealership. 

While I have had a few frustrating moments here, who is lucky enough to deal with a car dealership, or service department without a little frustration? Generally, I have very good experiences and have been a loyal customer of the service department since 2009 (when I moved to Florida). I also leased my 2014 Cruze here last year. While I do not think I got the best deal in the world, I will assign that blame to the sales man doing a good job and my lack of patience with bargaining when it is only a lease and I will be giving it back. 

So my most recent experience was a little less than stellar. I tried booking an appointment online instead of over the phone. I had some notes in the bottom notes section advising of my need for a rental car and stressing that I would need to reschedule my appointment if there was no rental. My notes about the rental car went unnoticed and so when I arrived, after sitting around for 15 minutes as phone calls were made during my blocked off appointment time, I learned of the policy change and I had to cancel my appointment and I was still late to work. 

I was not a happy camper and emailed a complaint through their website. I waited a maybe 30 minutes and after getting no response decided I would post my complaint here. I did and Maher Chevrolet quickly reached out to me. After a little bit of phone tag, I spoke with the manager. He was very apologetic and I was very appreciative. Obviously they cannot change a policy just for me, and I did not expect them to. I will be happy just knowing that they will review the notes section in more detail in the future and promptly advise when requests cannot be met. Even if they cannot call you, the moment you arrive for you appointment, someone working in the service department should quickly advise you that your request cannot be met, so you do not waste time sitting around only to learn you cannot be helped. As a side note, the dealership should contact the 3rd party that makes the maintenance software to get changes. Either (1) remove the notes section completely, because there are no flags to catch the service advisers attention, the notes section is at the very bottom and easy to miss; or (2) ADD SOME KIND OF FLAG. Obviously I prefer adding some sort of flag, but if that is too problematic, then just remove the notes all. If I were unable to leave notes, then I would be forced to call and there would be a higher likelihood it does not fall under the radar.

Still, Maher has great customer service with a friendly attitude. The dealership is a clean and updated. Despite the fact that my parents hope to retire from GM soon, they will be moving down here and will remain loyal to GM even if I may not. I am sure once they get down here from Detroit, they will bring their new Equinox in for service. I am seriously impressed with the quality of my Cruze LS compared to my prior Chevy Aveo.","Text1: A solid bubble tea place.  For Indy, pretty top notch.

0,"I should preface that my review on Bridgestone Arena is solely based on it being a music venue. Haven't been to a Preds game yet but the year is still young!

It's obvious that it lacks the character of The Ryman or War Memorial but comparing apples to oranges doesn't make a whole lot of sense, eh? Bridgestone is an arena that offers up the largest scale tours and chart topping musical offerings ranging from Paul McCartney & Ozzy Osbourne to the upcoming radio darling Katy Perry. (not a fan, by the way) Sound has always been consistently good, parking is priced normal for event parking, and the beer and concession are inflated. Nothing out of the ordinary for a venue of this caliber.

I happened to be in a company's boxed seating the other night and the service and offerings were great! And. Yes. I'm bragging!","We've been to other Shoney's before and knew what to expect.  However, I think this one needed some work.

The air conditioning must have been broken as it was hot as hell in the restaurant.  The buffet (which my family and I had) was only OK.  They did not refill empty slots fast enough, and food seemed dry and not too flavorful.  The salad dressings were not marked correctly, and the floor all around the buffet was slippery from something unknown.

Our staff was mostly attentive, but not the most friendly.","Text1: I should preface that my review on Bridgestone Arena is solely based on it being a music venue. Haven't been to a Preds game yet but the year is still young!

First of all, I am so pleased to see a place like this in my neighborhood. I think it's the perfect addition. The dining area is really cool looking and the whole place is incredibly clean. 

I had the Holmesburger and Hubby had the CW Special. We were both pretty blown away by our burgers. They had a ton of flavor and all the toppings were really balanced. We also shared an order of poutine and it was fantastic! I can't even describe how happy I am to be able to finally get poutine in my neighborhood. This is definitely the beginning of a long, prosperous relationship. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, CK! You guys are the real deal.","Dinner at ""District Donut Slider Brews"".

So tonight we decided to try somewhere new in the Garden District of New Orleans, Louisiana for food and we stumbled upon this place after our first choice was closed down(Yelp hadn't updated their page, so thanks for that, Yelp!) which ended up being a blessing in disguise!

The restaurant itself is quite long and narrow with seating available on the left and the cashier/bar/cooking areas located down the right. Along the side of the bar are bar stools for those who wish to have easy access to drinks/the workers through out their meal. Being able to see the food being prepared right in front of you in a nice touch as if you're paranoid about food preparation, you'll see there are no nasty surprises awaiting you.

So we(yes, ""we"", I didn't eat all that food myself!) ended up ordering a cheese burger slider, fried chicken slider, and two others(I didn't eat those) along with a side of fries. The sliders were delicious. A nice crisp bun with well cooked beef(cheese burger) and chicken(fried chicken) with appropriate dressing made the sliders an excellent experience. The fries were also quite good, had a nice crunch to them, no complaints at all.

For dessert, we ordered a 7 Layer Donut and an Elvis Donut. The 7 Layer was fantastic. Now, the 7 Layers are actually 7 different toppings but I can't remember most. What I remember, there was caramel, pecan, and coconut.  It was really delicious! The Elvis Donut..I didn't think too much of this one. It had caramel, bacon, and bananas. Three things I enjoy but definitely not when put together. 

Overall, the meal was very satisfying and very tasty. I highly recommend it to anyone who is in the New Orleans area.","Text1: I tried Commonwealth Kitchen this evening for the first time, and I will say I was very impressed.

1,"I knew as I stepped foot on the Village Pub's front porch, I was going to love it there. I felt right at home. 

We grabbed some stools at the bar and posted up to watch the 2011 Women's World Cup final game. As disappointing as the game was, the bar was the complete opposite. 

The bartender was extremely friendly and greeted us as soon as we sat down. He was even nice enough to let us know that it was 1/2 off all draught beers until 2 every Sunday. So for a little less than $3.50 you can get a 24oz glass of Sweetwater, or whatever it is you prefer. 

The food at this place is really great too. We ordered the pretzels with the beer cheese dipping sauce. That beer cheese sauce is so mint. We also, ordered the a veggie sandwich that was great too. 

I will for sure make the trek back to east Nashville for some more cheap beers and beer cheese.","Hands down...the BEST ice cream joint I have ever been to! I try and only go one a month or when I have friends in town, but I think they might put crack in this stuff! 
They have some many delicious flavors to choose from, that it often takes me a few minutes to decide what to get. Some of my favorites are: Salted Caramel, Oatmeal cookie, Red Velvet Cake, Lavender Honey, and Chocwork Orange. 
At lot of the flavors they only make once or twice. But, I really wish they would always carry salted caramel. I think I might be able to live off if that stuff!

They have some many delicious flavors to choose from, that it often takes me a few minutes to decide what to get. Some of my favorites are: Salted Caramel, Oatmeal cookie, Red Velvet Cake, Lavender Honey, and Chocwork Orange. 
At lot of the flavors they only make once or twice. But, I really wish they would always carry salted caramel. I think I might be able to live off if that stuff! 
Go here....NOW!!! I am actually considering leaving work to go get some! 
Just remember, CASH ONLY.",yes

I cant believe I forgot to review this place! PROS. : Open Late. Plain steak is okay. This is awesome to find this spot when the other spot down Front & Oregon is closed and you are starving late night!!!!","Brought kitty here when he wouldn't stop vomiting. It was a wait. This was my first Veterinary ER, so I didn't know what to expect. I was scared for my kitty. They diagnosed him with kidney failure and told me I had to take him to see a vet.

1,"This place is a strong 4 stars - maybe even 5 (but it's just not the same tier as a Nobu).  It's homey vibe and decidedly 2-3 star service (not bad - but weird service - a bit inattentive and spacey - hard to get a check - hard to ask questions) knock me down to a solid 4 stars.

Bright, homey decor and even the bathrooms feel clean and light.  Owner is very nice and has gorgeous eyes.  (Waiter was pretty hot, too.)

My good (lacto-ovo-vegetarian) friend and I had a delicious lunch there today.  I have 2 yummy glasses of the Lemonada (1/2 mint iced tea mixed with 1/2 lemonade - the PERFECT summer refresher.  My friend had Greek Coffee - made the traditional way.

For our lunch he had Shouksouka (delicious) - great for a breakfast or brunch, too.  Very rich and filling.  I had the Kanella platter and for $12 it was the perfect way to sample alot of offerings.  For me the best part were the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Now, I realize that everybody and everybody's grandma makes 'em dirrefently and Kanella's are distinctively sweet with currants and luscious Pine Nuts.  The falafel, Zucchinni fritter and yogurt were all good too.  The only thing I could not eat was the spicy tomato salad (next time I will order it made mild - if they can do that).  It was soooooo peppery with a ""harrissa-like"" taste to it.

Baklava was served with syrupy orange slices and was chock-full-o-nuts.  Very good for $3.50!

We plan to return.  But - please - beef uf your staff and service.","Odd.
Tacos & Donuts???  

I did not have any donuts but they looked good.
I got a Chopped Salad with overcooked (but tasty - great spice on it) steak.

Would have been great if the meat were at least pink.  (It was well, well, well done.)

$8.47 for a cheap lunch.

1,"Disclaimer: The decanter at the front door is not cucumber infused vodka. 

When I first entered The Island, my eyes immediately went to the large dispenser containing clear refreshing liquid with thinly sliced cucumbers floating inside.  I jokingly asked, ""is that cucumber infused vodka?"".  The jovial cashier, gave a hearty laugh and informed me it was ""just water"". I have to admit I was disappointed, but once I sampled and filled my bowl with Froyo I was whisked away to a tropical ""island"". 

Those big chain Froyo shops have nothing on The Island, in fact The Island has them beat with flavor, toppings and customer service. I'm a purest,  I like my yogurt plain like my flavored vodka. I like to experience their true flavors to the fullest. 

My ""island"" experience included; Madagascar Vanilla, Root Beer Float and Cheesecake. The Root Beer Float was as if you truly were having one, except it was all yogurt and no soda. If you crumbled up some graham crackers with the cheesecake, you'd think you were eating the real thing. However, the Madagascar Vanilla was my favorite, it had true vanilla flavoring. Even as a child my favorite ice cream was vanilla, I guess old habits are hard to break. 

I also grabbed some Banana FroYo to go, we had a neighbors birthday to celebrate when I got home from this UYE.  I forgot to mention this was a UYE sponsored by Miss Soulard herself, Mandie M.. If it were not for her, I would have never discovered this delightful yogurt shop.  By the way, the banana went great with a chocolate cake.","My recent visit to The Block, gives them an extra star. I'm happy to say, the CWE location is now on the same level as their sister location in Webster Groves. 

As those who follow my reviews, know I am a big fan of Fried Green Tomatoes. So when I saw them on the menu as an appetizer, I couldn't resist. Their green tomatoes were almost like a salad with the additional mixed greens and strips of bacon. The coating around the tomatoes was thick and crispy, but still giving you the great taste of fresh green tomato. If dining at lunch time, it could almost be a meal itself. 

My entree was the Pork Chop, which was thick, tender and juicy. It was served in a hot cast iron skillet with sautéed vegetables. I love the other white meat and The Block always serves it up well. 

I saved room for dessert, so I was excited to try their Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. It was a sweet treat.  If creme brûlée is on the menu, I order it and The Block, did it well. I'm always amazed at the crisp top on a brûlée and how creamy it is beneath. The vanilla flavor of this one, was strong which is fine with me, since vanilla is my favorite flavor.

A special touch that I like here at The Block is the way they serve salt & pepper. They don't use the typical shakers, they have small ramekins with tiny spoons. I've never had to use them, my food has always been seasoned well, but I like the unique presentation. 

I'll be returning soon to try their burger for lunch. Plus, I want more Brussels Sprouts, since I didn't enjoy an order this visit.

0,"Well if this isn't the most over rated place ever, I don't know what is.  It almost makes me want to open a restaurant just to watch everyone flock to it and take their money, and shut down just as the fad dies.  And I don't mean years later, when I start cutting corners and offering smaller portions and jacking prices while the service swan-dives...no, I'm talking about the minute a line 30 people deep, waiting for OK food vanishes.

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is just fine if you want mediocre brothy soup embellished with garlic or spice, decorated with half a hard boiled egg.  Is this really the trend?  It must be, because people line up to stand outside on Speedway next door to May's Chicken and Waffles.  I can't understand this - given the choice between waiting for 25 minutes for soup vs. no wait for chicken/waffles/burgers, I'm going next door from now on.

Small restaurant.  No outside seating.  Very reminiscent of Sweets Raku in Vegas, long lines for Costco desserts.

Food OK.  Tried the vegetarian and pork ramen as well as the miso.  Tasty - NOT WORTH $12 - NOT WORTH 30 MINUTE WAIT.

For the love of the Yelp God, go eat some Pho.  Easily twice as filling, about $3 less expensive, and NO 30 MINUTE WAIT!!!","Not the worst, but surely not the best.  I came here for a Yelp Elite event and ordered the Avocado Club Burger with a side of the smash fries.  The fries were a bit cool, so I wasn't able to enjoy them like they should be enjoyed, so my judgment of them is moot.  The patty of the burger was a bit dry for my taste.  New Orleans has opened so many new great burger joints within the last year or two, so my expectations for burgers are quite high.  Unfortunately, Smashburger did not meet those expectations.  So I'll keep this short, if you're looking for a place to quickly sate your burger cravings, Smashburger might just do the tricky (depending on your expectations), but if you've already tried Cowbell and Company Burger, Smashburger will just not do it for you.

0,"We have started including La Monarca in our Sunday lunch rotation.  Most recently we have enjoyed some good tortas that were very large and filling.  I had mine al pastor and Ms T had pollo.  Both were very good, well seasoned and dressed.

We love their salsas and chips which are served warm.  The salsas are unique.  The red is very well flavored with red chile and loaded with garlic.  The green is loaded with fresh jalapeno flavor and although it has a little tomatillo, is not tart as you would expect.  These break away from the predictable tomato versions.

We eat light for lunch and the plate two tacos works well.  On our most recent visit, I had the saudero (grilled pork).  It was a little dry, but cubed small and seasoned.  It is obviously pre-cooked and then grilled to crisp it up.  It has a nice crispy texture.  Ms T had pollo again, but this time on a huarache.  The huarache is fried and is crisp but a little hard to eat.  Never the less, this is very genuine Mexican food.

0,"This place is literally magical.  

Here's the story.  We bought a car with what we thought was road paint or concrete stuck to the bottom half of the car right near the front wheel.  Oh well.  We had gotten it washed at numerous places including expensive places like the one on Spring Garden and 11th.

Fast forward to our trip to Magic Car Wash.  They have a strange system where you get out of the car while it goes through the car wash only to come out driven by a gentleman.  At this point, I notice that there was still a stain on the door right above the paint/concrete.  This is what I thought the worker was going to attend to when he approached the car with a spray bottle of magical fluid.  Instead, he started working on the paint/concrete in what I thought was in vain.  NOPE.  He actually cleaned the paint/concrete off in a move that caused both my fianceé and my jaw to drop.  

They seriously went above and beyond any normal car wash place.  I will take my car here as long as I live in this area, for sure.","This review is based on my recent visit during their happy hour, and thus I do not have direct experience with dining here are a fully meal diner. Their happy hour food list if somewhat limited, but certainly satisfying. You can combine the sliders, for example, to include both vegetarian and meat items. But based on what I saw during seated at the bar, and the quality of the items served, I would recommend not only the happy hour menu, but most likely the menu itself. The bartender was friendly and attentive, as was the restaurant host. This was like the staff at the associated Kimpton Hotel (Palomar), where they always seem pleased to see you, and are highly professional. Definitely I would come back again.","Text1: This place is literally magical.

His mechanic concurred, most unfortunately,  with Sear's quote.  All
of that pricey stuff WAS needed. 

I got a slightly lower quoted price than the Sears quote & supposedly about $300 off to get it there.  With genuine Nissan parts - I took it!

Two days later I dropped off my car & enjoyed driving around in a 2017 Rogue for the day!

We were there on a Wednesday which apparently was Trivia Night and it was packed by 6:30.  You can sit anywhere that doesn't have a 'Reserved' sign on it so we found ourselves a nice booth.

Going by Jerry G.'s awesome review from awhile back, we had to order the Fish & Chips.  Also, because we can't get enough fried food in our diets, we ordered a side of Onion Rings. (see pics)  The Fish & Chips were piping hot, crispy and delicious!  It was a huge portion.  The Onion Rings were great, too.  They came with a horseradish sauce for dipping. 

Despite the large crowd, the service was fast and friendly.  Their menu is vast and we are going to try to work our way through it.  We had a great meal.  I would definitely recommend Finley's for a drink or dinner.","This place is ok.  The first time I went, they put my group of 5 upstairs with an incredibly noisy family gathering.  The service is fine and the manager/owner is always very friendly, but the place is a bit cramped.  The food is not cheap but you can tell it's been made with care.  It's BYO which is a plus and it has a very intimate setting downstairs.

Bruschetta, grilled calamari, mussels for appetizers, homemade pastas as an entree make for a decent meal.

They have some good looking burritos and tacos too.",no
1,"Companion is one of the best lunch spots in Clayton.  The menu is salads, sandwiches and soups.  If you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal.  I actually worked at companion back in 2001... What a change it has gone through, but the food is still just as yummy.  

My salad rotation goes between the Picnic Basket and the Go Green... But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.

I will always love Companion and go for lunch a lot - it's basically every week at this point.","Pi has got to be one of the hardest places in St. Louis to get a table in...the wait has to be atleast 30-45 minutes long on a Friday or Saturday night.  The wait, I guess...is worth it.  The drinks at Pi are great.  Pi (2) is great and so is the cubini.  It is definitely a place for happy hour and a must go to for a night out with the ladies trying to have a few fab drinks and act tready [per say]. 

The pizza at Pi is good, I don't love their deep dish pizza, but their regular crust pizza is pretty phenomenal. I usually get something that is simple like a tomato basil regular crust pizza, however this weekend I went a little fancier and got a pizza with tomatoes, zucchini, and some other delicious ingredients topping it off.  I went with a group of 8 and the rest of the gang got the deep dish and devoured every single piece. 

Pi is a great hangout, try going on a night that isn't so popular for eating, and drinking out! The loop is also the perfect location for a low key night or a night on the town. Get after it!","Text1: Companion is one of the best lunch spots in Clayton.  The menu is salads, sandwiches and soups.

0,"OK, I've got to downgrade my score a bit after my second experience. 

Came in with a decent sized group after attending wine on the river, so I must admit that parts of this meal are slightly hazy. However, after doing a bit of detective work, I have pieced together my experience. 

What I remember: 
-Ordering a turkey burger and the famous potatoes on the side
-Having one well liquor drink
-The potatoes being extremely soggy and floppy

Fast forward to two days later. This is me checking my credit card statement:

""Holy $*&^ I spent $50 at National Underground?? How did that happen?""

Then the pieces started falling into place. 
-I picked up the tab for my BF (still. TWO burgers and two drinks- a beer and well vodka should not be $50)
-We had to buy BOTTLED water. That cost $2 extra per bottle. 
-There was an up charge for the potatoes that were floppy and not good

Yikes. That's a lot for a drunken meal that I half remember. I had a good experience the first time when I was a bit more coherent, so I'm definitely going to try and be a lot more careful when eating here. If it's late night, I'm choosing Broadway Brewhouse, and next year I think Mexican food is more appropriate for post wine on the river food.","Crap. I think I am living up to my tag line, ""I may be too nice for Yelp"". I think its because I spend too much time on here and only go to the places that give decent reviews.... but I digress. 

So, we showed up at about 615 with no reservation. We were seated right away. (And we didn't get the crappy table by the bar...woohoo!) The busboy came and offered an assortment of waters almost immediately. We decided to live on the edge and go with tap.. we were feeling crazy. 

Our waitress showed up promptly thereafter and asked us if we had any questions, explained the specials, and whether we were needing to be finished in time for anything (apparently a lot of theater goers come in before the show...). We were not in any hurry. My hubby ordered a mixed beer that wasn't on the signature drink list, but since he saw they had the ingredients for, requested. It came out great. My wine was good. 

So, you know when you go somewhere that has dishes you don't see in many other places... and you know you should try them... but then don't, well yeah. I feel bad reviewing the food based on what we ordered, but I will do it anyway. We seriously ordered a salad to split (which if the kitchen splits it for you there is an upcharge, but I am lazy and don't care) , I ordered one of the pizzas, and hubby ordered the burger. It was the mood we were in, deal with it. 

We got the Bibb salad. The figs and hazelnuts were good and the lettuce crisp. The first bite of the vinaigrette was a little tart. But then it smoothed out. I had the roasted garlic, mushroom, arugula, goat cheese pizza. MMMM. It was really good. But with simple ingredients I really do expect nothing less. 

My hubby's burger was huge. But it came out cooked perfectly. He added the Gruyere and mushrooms. I did taste it, and it was a very tasty burger. Again, with something somewhat simple like that, I expect it not to be screwed up. And surprisingly, I really enjoyed the fries. They were thin, but not quite shoestring? I dunno. But they were good. 

Overall, our service was prompt and everyone was friendly. Our waitress was good. The food was good. I definitely dig the atmosphere. 

Yep... I will go back... with every intention of trying something a little more complicated than a burger and pizza.","Text1: OK, I've got to downgrade my score a bit after my second experience.

1,"I haven't been to Queen in a long time due to my love for Emma's Nails.  But I needed a quick mani and couldn't make it to my usual spot so I figured what the hay.  Ugh what the no.  Why is the salon so cold?!  Do they not have heat?!  And I'm sorry (not sorry) but if you are a nail tech you should be an expert in painting nails.  My tech was nice, she trimmed my cuticles pretty well and didn't cut me, but her polish skills were weak!  The color I chose was applied so thin it barely even shows up.  And it looks streaky.  Same with the top coat, barely applied.  I don't know if she was being thrifty with the polish or what.  And two of my nails have a noticeable bump at the cuticle like a hard piece of nail polish.

They have a great selection of polishes including OPI, Essie, and China Glaze as well as several gel options.  I chose OPI GelColor and got a mani-pedi and it was very nice.  My technician Linda was friendly and gentle.  No cuticle nicks or aggressive filing.  Polish looks nice and smooth and the gel is perfect.  Basic pedi and gel mani was $35 and included hot stones.  My only complaints are a) the massage was basically non-existant and b) the scrub and lotion were absolutely freezing!

0,"I'm certainly not a vegetarian, but I wouldn't say that I adore eating meat all the time, either. But! The promise of a good BBQ place is definitely enticing. 

We went on a weekday around 5:30pm, so the restaurant was not busy when we got there. However, it did fill up steadily after that. I liked the decor. Western flavour but subtle and well done. 

I was tempted to order an appetizer but decided against it because I knew the mains would be too big. I was also tempted to just go with a pulled pork sandwich, but we decided to go all out and share two big mains to really get a taste of what they were all about. We ordered a half rack of ribs ($16 I believe) and the Road Kill ($18). I have never seen a bigger freakin' sandwich in my life. I thought the ribs were good but I wasn't blown away by them. I think I had really built up the anticipation due to reading all of the wonderful reviews. I didn't even know how to tackle the Road Kill, so I sort of just stabbed and sliced and picked parts off of it. I think it would have been a better experience if I could have bitten through the whole thing and had all of the flavours at the same time. The waffle bread was a nice touch. 

The service was fine. Our waitress indicated to us that she was new, but she did a good job. Sure, the food took a bit longer to come out than other places, but I think that's to be expected at a BBQ restaurant.

I don't think I would ever become a regular here just due to the sheer amount of meat. I only managed to eat two ribs and about 25% of the Road Kill. I would like to go back to try something smaller, perhaps the pulled pork or beef brisket sandwich, or maybe a couple of the appetizers as a meal in themselves.","We usually come here for a quick bite to eat.  

The servers are always nice and helpful.   

The nachos are yummy!   Just had the BBQ chicken flat bread  - very tasty.

Tuesday night seems to be kids night.   Free kids meal with adult meal purchase.   No argument here.

I had to up my review from a 4 star to 5 star.  We visited this location and I ordered the chili (as I usually do).  It tasted off and smelled weird.  I told the waitress that it didn't taste right and she took it away with no problem.

10 minutes later the manager comes over and tells me she is sorry about the chili and that she checked the batch and it was a bit over cooked/burnt. During the course of the day the chili temperature increased and burnt the chili. She thanked me and was really happy I told her .    I never expected that .. I just expected it to come off my bill.. Never that the manager would actually check the batch and act on me saying it tasted weird.  Bravo..  So glad we eat here a lot.  great place.","Text1: I'm certainly not a vegetarian, but I wouldn't say that I adore eating meat all the time, either. But!

The service was great, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty of it.  We had the barbecued ribs and chicken, baked beans, mac and cheese, potato salad and green salad.

We stopped in for a (very ample) tasting a few months ago and that went very well too, which is why we decided to have them cater our event.  We got to sample pretty much everything (yay!) - it was all wonderful so it was pretty hard to decide which sides to get.

Things like no multiple orders in the drive-thru, even on a slow day.

There seems to be high staff turnover and many of the staff are less-than-competent even at the simple task of making coffee by recipe or running a till.

Things like no multiple orders in the drive-thru, even on a slow day.

There seems to be high staff turnover and many of the staff are less-than-competent even at the simple task of making coffee by recipe or running a till.

Head to 91st & Ellerslie or Windermere for a better experience. 

 Text2: I'm not a hunter, and it's been years since I fished, but I love this store!

Their prices are actually very reasonable (I did some comparison shopping with Amazon and other sources), and their selection is pretty incredible.

1,Byo! Gotta love that. Used a groupon so it was a good deal. Got the yelp favorites: salt baked squid and sea bass dish. Both were very good. I was not crazy about the own fried noodles. They were drenched in a brown sauce. And the shredded pork was not good with it. We ordered sauteed dumplings and one side of each was slightly burned. Found that odd - obviously a mistake.  Overall it was hit or miss with the dishes so stick to the recommendations.,"London Grill is one of my favorite bars, and it isn't just because it was the location of my first date with my husband!  It is an all-around good place, where you can go on a first date, or catch happy hour after work, or bring your parents for brunch. You can't go wrong here!  The bartenders and wait staff are friendly, food comes out quickly, and they have a good variety of dishes.

London Grill is the ultimate neighborhood bar.  Some of the people at the bar are always there and the bartenders seem to know everyone.  The food is consistently good.  We usually go here for happy hour because they have a great selection of beers for $3 and the small plates are a decent size. They also have happy hour on Saturday afternoons 3-5 and Sunday evenings 9-11 (just drink specials).  Sweet!  

The meatballs are excellent! Now that I am vegetarian, I am really going to miss them.... and the duck spring rolls, yum!  

It is a great place to sit outside when the weather is nice.  You can order a bucket of Coronas and hang out overlooking Fairmount Ave and the prison.  Brunch is also excellent - especially the bloody mary bar!","Text1: Byo! Gotta love that. Used a groupon so it was a good deal. Got the yelp favorites: salt baked squid and sea bass dish.

Wednesday is 1/2 price boneless wings and Monday is the Shrimp deal.

Love to take my 6 year old here - as I, probably should not even contemplate eating this.  It's an OCCAISIONAL treat only.  And we get celery in lieu of fries - and I get a salad - so I feel a little less guilty.

Bring on the fried shrimp!
And corn dogs. (Big and slightly sweet batter.)  Umm!","In fast food circles, this diner style restaurant chain is one of the best and this location is better than average.  They re-did this  particular Steak 'n Shake about 10-15 years ago, but it has been at that corner since the 1950's.

Positives:
It's cheap and everything is made to order
Drive thru service is available 24 hours at this location
Table Service available, if dining inside
The BEST vanilla ice cream around and the sundaes, shakes and malts are AWESOME!
The ""Steak-burger"" can be greasy at times, but it is made from a combo of T-bone, sirloin, and round steaks and is NOT the grade D beef, that most fast food restaurants serve.
Chili 5-way is a heart attack waiting to happen, but oh so yummy
They have REAL breakfast with REAL eggs.

1,"There are several things I love in this world. Three of them are: yoga, being outside, and free stuff. Yoga on the Pier combines all three! 

Here are the details:

+ Class every weekday day (except Wednesday) at 7am, 
+ 6pm class Thursday. 
+ Saturday and Sunday weekend class at 9:30 am.
+ FREE! There's a donation bucket at the end of class, but it's pretty low pressure which I really appreciate.
+ Malik Wilson, the instructor I've had twice now. is AWESOME. Great hands on assists and great classes.
+ Get there 10 minutes early or so to get a good spot, it can be harder to hear if you are further away (although they often have over instructors walking around to give directions.
+ 10% discount at Cafe Ole for mentioning Yoga on the Pier.
+ BYO Mat, towel, water, and SUNSCREEN. Downward Dog=Awkward sunburn
+ All levels classes that are still a great workout.

Head on over to their fb group and like them for updates!

ALSO Yoga on the Pier got me on TV! Basically I'm so famous that coworkers' husbands and people who I went to high school with's moms are calling them being like, didn't you go to high school with that girl Melissa P? She's on TV at some obscurely late night time talking about how awesome free outdoor yoga is. Ok so it was two people and someone's instagram. ok it was my instagram. Still counts!

Definitely check it out!","This place makes me channel my inner Julia Stiles circa Save the Last Dance, wishing I was more Center Stage than awkward white girl koreshing ... and burning. Had to. 

WARNING: THEY HAVE MOVED! Just checked out their new studio for a free class yesterday  (located at 20th and Rittenhouse) and LOVED IT. Hated myself for being an uncoordinated mess, but whatevs.

I don't know that the new studio itself is that much more spacious (although the area to hang out in pre-class is, and there is now a small locker room) Then again the huge crowd that turned out for the free class probably did not help...

HIP HOP CLASSES
I've been to Sammy's beginner (intro $5 class-print the coupon off their site!) and intermediate (lol I know, but it was free) hip hop and he is amazing. He is a hilarious, fierce, fast dancing, fast talking, AWESOME teacher, and he will make you wish you were as cool as him and make you want to be a hip hop dancer. His classes are basically some warm ups, then he teaches you a routine, and then halves of the room alternate doing the routine. Everyone is very supportive and claps and doesn't give you death stares even if you suck and can't get the steps and are always in everyone's way because you are 5 beats behind.

CAVEATS: 
1. If you are not a dancer and just want a workout class, like me, this will be challenging, but you'll get a workout for sure.
2. The prices. They are high. $20 is steep if you are not a dancer.

Recommend for dancers, and to everyone who has $5 and could use a laugh/sweat/pick-me-up!","Text1: There are several things I love in this world. Three of them are: yoga, being outside, and free stuff. Yoga on the Pier combines all three!

1,"When I would frequent Spice Corner I was in college, broke, and not into cooking at all (unless ""cooking"" frozen foods counts). The only reason I'd go is to get loose teas at a reasonable price. I now regret not living closer because I've developed a taste for coffee and cooking, and Spice Corner serves the cook and coffee drinker with their diverse selection of spices and many flavored coffee beans. The only downside of this place is that it's quite small and it's difficult to maneuver around in. It's all worth it in the end, though. Your taste buds will thank you for visiting!","Went to El Camino for brunch this weekend. It was not as good as my dinner was previously.

The huevos rancheros was served in a cast iron skillet, which is cool, but it really wasn't doing it for me. It kind of tasted bland and the refried beans were more like a soup than they were like a refried bean. Also, the breakfast burrito doesn't come with any type of sauce like guac or sour cream, and I think that's just weird.

Our waitress, while very pretty (Megan Fox look-alike), was pretty checked out. She didn't come over to check on us and only refilled our water glasses after my friend had to start drinking out of my glass. She also didn't ask if I wanted a refill of my coffee. When my friend asked for ketchup she brought the bottle to our table and slid it across the table. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was pretty rude.

I'll stick with Green Eggs or Cantina Dos Segundos for breakfast now on.","Text1: When I would frequent Spice Corner I was in college, broke, and not into cooking at all (unless ""cooking"" frozen foods counts).

1,"Pancake house by day, steakhouse by night!  If you have read any of the other reviews (particularly for Gaucho Steakhouse), then you will see there have been a number of bewildered guests that have dined here.  The family that owns this brunch restaurant closes the place at 3, cleans up, and then reopens as Gaucho Brazilian Steakhouse at 5 pm.  Both restaurants use the same entrance and space, but the signs over the entrance make it look like the pancake house is on the left and the steakhouse is on the right.  Just go to the left, regardless of when you dine here.

Okay, so the space inside is not designed for clearing things up.  There are large murals on the walls celebrating breakfast and area sports teams.  And there are posters about steak as well.  The space is broken up into two shotgun style dining areas.  The one on the entrance side has a number of tables and a bar area towards the back.  The space to the right is divided by a mirrored wall that is lined with booth seating for the tables that are located there.  Pull out chairs sit on the opposite sides of the bench seating.   

Anyway, I ordered my brunch selection and a bottomless cup of coffee and was generally pleased.  The ""Original Benny"" came with two poached eggs, a buttery Hollandaise sauce, English muffin halves, and Canadian bacon.  Pretty well executed and tasty.  On the same plate, some crisped hash browns came with the order to help mop up any of the sauce left over.  On a side plate, a colorful fresh fruit plate offered melon, red grapes, and orange slices.

The service was okay....efficient comes to mind.  Not a lot of interaction or welcoming attitude.  I could understand if it was a busy day, but the room seemed less than half full.

Overall, if you are hungry, the food is good and you just have to trust the staff to lead you to seating.  Don't over think it.

Review #503","My wife and I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and arrived just as they opened. One of the employees was still mopping the floor while we waited for our server to arrive to take our orders.  Since our order was first in line, we had great turnaround on having our food brought out.  We started with an order of gyoza (5 dumplings) which were crisped and served with lemon slices and a small amount dipping sauce.  The flavor was good, but the serving tray reservoir for the sauce was too small for the dumplings to be dunked in so about half the sauce went unused and too little got on the gyoza.

We each were brought a side salad before our entrees came out.  The iceberg lettuce was crisp and generally bite sized and loaded with the house dressing.  The flavor was quite good, but they could have used less dressing.

I also got a bowl of Miso soup which I found to be one of the best I've had!  As I stirred it, the soup went from a mostly broth like appearance to a more cloudy look.  The flavor had a more salty taste than most versions I've had elsewhere.

But then the entrees arrived and the disappointment arrived with it.  My wife ordered the Beef Teryaki and she might as well have ordered an ill prepared liver and onions.  The pre-sliced beef was served with a teryaki sauce on top, while presented of sliced white onions.  There was nothing about onions in the description, so she was surprised.  The beef was over cooked and dry, especially on the outer slices to the point it was tougher and chewier than it should have been.  The plate came with some unseasoned white rice.

I had ordered a Bento box and it came with more of the plain white rice, some orange slices, and my choice of roll (avocado), and meat (teryaki shrimp) served over the undisclosed sliced white onions.  The shrimp was also over cooked so that they were rubbery.  The flavor was good, it's just the texture was unappealing.

So, some of the apps were good, but both entrees were misses.  Having read some other reviews, I was expecting much better quality.  

Note:  The approach to the restaurant out front could use some cleaning and the stairs were quite steep.  If you have trouble with stairs, I suggest approaching from the rear where the parking lot is the same level as the restaurant.

I'd pass this place by if I were you.  It's overrated.","Really, really good food here. Had reservations for 10, at 9:30 on a Saturday night.   The place was still busy & filled up, but we were seated within a few minutes.  No problem at all...just grabbed a Victory Brew from the bar while we waited. Now that's a beer that get's better every single time I have it...(or, maybe I'm just developing a resistance to the bitterness that I remember from college???). Anyway, it went down mighty easily, and over the years, I've learned the hard way that drinking too many of them will instill upon you in the next day some of the worst feelings known to man.  Awh, heck...as they say ""Victory Comes at a Price"" :)

So there I was, thinking that we would be the only idiots eating dinner that late, but...this is West Chester, on a Saturday night...(I was wrong)! The place was crowded and loud, but nothing that would draw you away.   A very nice waitress seated us in the back at a large round table, and we had drinks & menus in no time at all.  These people were working towards the end of what was likely a very long & hectic shift, but they still managed to seem like they were enjoying being there. Very polite, and easy smiles. As I've learned from sisters & friends once in that line of work....being fake is what waitress do very well!     Anyway, there are good reasons this place was so busy. The menu is large, the atmosphere was pleasant, the food was delicious, and I'll definitely go back there again...maybe on a weeknight that's hopefully less crowded.  Not too pricey either, considering where & what it is.

0,"Ben (chef/owner)  from Salume Beddu and Andrey (General Manager)  from 33 Wine Shop have taken an old 1930's gas station and turned it into a trendy little wine bar. The bar area is compact, cozy and all the windows give it a felling  of being larger then it really is. 

Great wine by the glass, tasting flights measured to perfection and an impressive selection of liquor as well. I went craving a red wine, but when I saw they offered Tito's Vodka my favorite I was swayed away. 

We enjoyed a sampling of artisan cured meats and hard cheese served with fresh bread and oil. 

A great place for Happy Hour or after theater drinks.","The rumors and reviews are true.  What used to be a way above average sushi experience - it is in my memory, as it seems to be in many other reviewers - is now thoroughly disappointing, pushy, and not worthy of a return trip.

But... Ru San's menu is SO huge.  And exciting.  The dinner menu looks so full of creative sushi that it just may lure me back.  First I have to recover from my lunch buffet experience.  Please continue.

I went to Ru San's for the infamous sushi buffet.  It was scarcely filled with business types enjoying lunch.  Hardly packed, yet the music was LOUD.  I wonder if a crowded Friday night drowns out the volume of the techno music.

The cost is around $10, plus tax.  Pretty good price if you want to eat more than a roll or two's worth of sushi.  However, at Ru San's buffet, I thought I was paying for variety.  Wouldn't you assume that a sushi buffet suggests many different types of sushi?  Think again, because almost every single piece of sushi on the buffet 1) was fried, 2) was made of some combination of a) avocado, b) cucumber, and c) imitation crab, and last and certainly not least, 3) was ugly.  Sushi is about presentation, and I think I could have rolled a prettier roll at home with my home sushi kit.  Mastering the art of sushi takes YEARS, and while it doesn't bother me that the sushi ""chefs"" at Ru San's don't have many years of sushi-making under their belt, the sushi they are rolling could at least look a little more appetizing.  Oh, and there wasn't a piece of nigiri in sight.

I remember Ru San's buffet including a variety of hot dishes, many of them very un-Japanese.  I remember some creamy pasta things, foods that included cheese and other egg/dairy ingredients.  These were inauthentic, but tasted good.  Well, these items were no longer present.  They were replaced by what looked like mediocre take-out Chinese, and a poor imitation of squid tempura.  

At the end of my meal, I was urged by a waiter to try the dessert of fried banana (the only dessert presented on the buffet) because it was ""so good!""  Well, I had already had one piece, and one piece was more than enough.  When I paid and got up to leave the same waiter said, ""See you tomorrow!""  

You know what?  No.  They won't see me tomorrow, and never again for lunch.  But like I said, I'll have to get back to you when it comes to dinner at Ru San's.  Here is my reasoning:  Their menu is so enormous and creative.  Deceiving, considering 85% of the items don't seem to see the light of the lunch buffet.  Ru San's is also the only Japanese place I know of that offers Zipang, the sparkling sake drink.  And they have some inexpensive offers, like dollar per sushi specials.  And you can get just a few pieces of one roll, allowing you to sample a large variety of foods in one meal.  As stated, the verdict is out.","Text1: Ben (chef/owner)  from Salume Beddu and Andrey (General Manager)  from 33 Wine Shop have taken an old 1930's gas station and turned it into a trendy little wine bar. The bar area is compact, cozy and all the windows give it a felling  of being larger then it really is.

0,"Finally, I got a chance to make it Federal Street Donuts!  I have been hearing about this place for some time now though various media coverage.   I did not arrive there until 2pm in the afternoon, which led to anticipation and anxiety.  Both of these emotions were from hoping they were open, not sold out of donuts or Fried Chicken, and hoping that the line would not be too long.   They were sold out of their Fancy donuts, but they had plenty of their Hot Fresh donuts, which come in three flavors: Appollonia, Indian Cinnamon, and Vanilla-Lavender.  I was super geeked that they still had chicken.   

I ordered each flavor of the Hot Fresh donuts and I ordered a half of chicken, which consist of a breast split in half, one drumstick, and one thigh.  You have the option of putting a dry rub or a wet rub on your chicken.  Torn between the dry rub and the wet rub, I went with my first inclination and ordered the harrissa dry rub. 

On the surface, chicken and donuts seem like an odd combination, but they pair together well, just like chicken and waffles.   The fried chicken is Korean-style, which made it super crunchy, and the donuts were warm and delicious.  I can see why this place is so popular.  They serve up donuts and chicken that is different from the norm.","Fellini Cafe is a wonderful small Italian restaurant. Two of us had pasta for lunch, with a salad and bruschetta to start. Service was snappy: from being seated to the delivery of our food, we did not wait long.

The food itself was delightful. Of the dishes we ordered, we loved all 4 and the only thing I could criticize (and this is trivial) is that I felt there was too much tomato on the bruschetta.

Service was patient and friendly. Our water glasses were refilled attentively. The staff were cheery and genuinely concerned that we were happy. For context, we arrive immediately after a party of at least 10 had just been seated, yet we received excellent service.

The dining area was nicely decorated and quite clean.

We will certainly be returning.","Text1: Finally, I got a chance to make it Federal Street Donuts!  I have been hearing about this place for some time now though various media coverage.

1,I had the ribs and corn grits at a fundraiser Zea sponsored before and gained an extra ten pounds eating the ribs alone. The corn grits are good but not great. Today I tried them again and the ribs were great with delicious broccoli and sweet potatoes. I'm a big fan of duck and will try their version next time. Zea's is not just about chicken. Tip: much cheaper and bigger portions if you take out rather than eating in.,Like the rest of the reviews say the pizza here is nothing special even though I do like the this NYC style crust. You cant beat the $5 for beer and slice of three meat pizza though.,"Text1: I had the ribs and corn grits at a fundraiser Zea sponsored before and gained an extra ten pounds eating the ribs alone.

These fries are far superior to their truffle parm fries. Perfectly salty and crispy.  Burger was simple, greasy, cheesy, and deliciously fantastic. mmmm beef...  Anyhow, we love this place and will certainly be back!","Wow awesome deli with huge, tasty sandwiches. The Muffaletta was super traditional and very good. It came served on a round roll just like in NOLA.  The Feisty Tuna was phenomenal. The tomatoes, hot giardiniera, and spicy sauce are awesome and really make this sammy pop!  Kinda sloppy eating but sooo worth it.  Slaw was creamy and standard.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The line moved quickly and food came out after a short wait.

marc (the host taking our order) was so incredibly friendly and fun! my friend ordered before me which gave me time to peruse their menu. she ordered a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and guacamole. marc made sure to express his surprise with the addition of guac lol 

i ordered the turbo which came with pickled jalapenos and added raw onions. my friend made a comment and marc gave me props for it because he also likes raw onions on his burgers. he really made my experience here great. 

since i work around the corner and love burgers, i will def be stopping by again. also, the burgers and fries are fucking delicious. the end.","I have only dealt with the pharmacy and I can say that everyone was pleasant to deal with.

1,"Like other Anthony's, it is decorated with celebrity posters in the by-gone era. There is a small bar and plenty of tables. There are even tables outside. The staff is friendly and will take you to a seat.

There is no question that Anthony's Coal House Pizza is one of the best pies around. Thin crusted and baked well in their very hot ovens makes a great combination. We liked the abundance of pepperoni and sausage on our selected pizza. There is plenty left over to take home for another meal.

We started off with baked chicken wings. This restaurant allows you to order any combination of wings, i.e. drums, wings or both. Our drums came out tasty with a good amount of cooked onions. The onions do indeed give it a special taste. 

My wife liked the salad. She also ordered the meatballs that came out tender and tasty. On our last visit, though, the sauce was quite 'salty.' I had some afterwards and it did make me quite thirsty.","This is more a venue than a park.

My only real complaint is the service. Our waters and coffees were not refilled. The service was very slow and our waitress was quite scatter-brained. I thought we were quite patient.

Like the northside Harry and Izzy's, there's nothing really ""wrong"" with this place except their steaks are not USDA prime. You can look up the difference in price between USDA prime and choice.

The issue is that other steakhouses in its price range use USDA prime meat for its steaks. There is a definite difference in quality between prime and choice - it's not a gimmick. Prime is significantly more tender because it's better marbled - there is more fat interspersed in the lean meat.

For the prices they are charging, they need to serve prime.","Text1: I'm really glad that I visited this place. It's a very nice breakfast/lunch cafe that you could visit right after church on Sunday. There are a lot of options and it's not too pricey.

This is more of a review of the Megabus drop-off / pick-up location than the bus experience itself. Coldest day of the year. Snow. Wind. To boot, a bungled, botched box of a Santa suit in my hands.

I'll drop the box, the santa suit will come tumbling out, it'll fall in the slush, a horse & carriage will purge innards onto it and then Megabus will speed off from the stoplight splashing grease-splayed splats all over the santa suit -- and my luggage, and me.

That is all. Enjoy!","I don't even like barbecue and I like LA Smokehouse. It is right off the Earhart expressway which is very convenient coming from 70123. It's an order at the counter type place so its good for a quick or casual lunch. 

For not being a full service place, the service was great! The lady at the counter was super nice. The customer in front of us was also a first timer so she explained the menu to us really well and offered some good suggestions, while we gazed at the big menu on the wall above us. She also told us about the check in deal on Yelp. Sweet!! 

I ordered the bbq chicken salad and it was a great salad because there was more toppings than actual lettuce, which in my opinion is exactly how a salad should be. The chicken had a very smokey flavor so if you love that whole bbq smoke thing, you will love this place. I really liked that they had other options besides the standard BBQ meat plates with sides. I did have serious food jealousy of my husbands mac and cheese. He shared so he is a keeper. 

I would go back and try more of the yummy sides. Great spot for lunch or for take out! Plus, plenty of free parking making it easy to get in and out.","Text1: Quick follow up to my previous review.

 Text2: I don't even like barbecue and I like LA Smokehouse. It is right off the Earhart expressway which is very convenient coming from 70123. It's an order at the counter type place so its good for a quick or casual lunch. 

For not being a full service place, the service was great! The lady at the counter was super nice. The customer in front of us was also a first timer so she explained the menu to us really well and offered some good suggestions, while we gazed at the big menu on the wall above us. She also told us about the check in deal on Yelp. Sweet!! 

I ordered the bbq chicken salad and it was a great salad because there was more toppings than actual lettuce, which in my opinion is exactly how a salad should be. The chicken had a very smokey flavor so if you love that whole bbq smoke thing, you will love this place. I really liked that they had other options besides the standard BBQ meat plates with sides. I did have serious food jealousy of my husbands mac and cheese. He shared so he is a keeper.

1,"Friendly service, games to play and food was ok. Fried Oysters were good, fries needed some seasoning. Flounder sandwich tasted ok, but came back later on me.
Music is pretty loud.","Had the service been better I would have probably said this was closer to 4 stars. When it takes almost 20 minutes to bring out a salad and an order of tempura vegetables you wonder what the hold up was since they weren't that busy. The worst part was, just as we started eating our first course another waiter brought out our dinners.  Seems like the kitchen needs a little better idea of pacing a meal or they were confused that night.
Anyway, the Caesar was ok, but surprisingly the Tempura app. was better than we expected.
The Bucatini with clams would have been better with lots of minced clams instead of 6 tiny clams on the edge of the bowl. The pasta was cooked al dente and it was tasty. The pork chop, which they had to reheat because of the mix up in the kitchen was well seasoned and came with mashed potato's and fresh asparagus.
Probably go back since the food was above average.
Street parking, they take all major credit cards and it is BYO.","Text1: Friendly service, games to play and food was ok. Fried Oysters were good, fries needed some seasoning. Flounder sandwich tasted ok, but came back later on me.

1,"I read a bunch of reviews before going, so I was prepared for the wait and delicious food. I got both, just as planned. The wait wasn't too bad for just a two-top, about 15 minutes. The eggs benedict was everything they said it would be. I added a potato latke because everyone kept raving about it and it was delicious (although, it's hard to fry a potato and make it not delicious to me!) with a necessary side of apple sauce and sour cream- yum! 

I can definitely see what all the hype is about. I like the benches outside for waiting if it's nice weather and they have outdoor seating, which is always a plus. The inside was quite small, but in a nice way, very Philly-ish. If you've been a fan of Sabrina's in the Italian Market, I get the same vibe from this place (although the patrons are more hipster here). I think the service here is better than most. They were friendlier and really on top of their game here. I'd def. go back!

Special Note: If you participate in RecycleBank, they have a couple of coupons for Honey's! Check it out!","A great little yoga studio on South Street. I'm currently participating in the prenatal yoga here and I love it. The instructors are great and the space is serene. The props are all wonderful and I don't have to lug my own mat there, which is particularly nice. 

At the end of each class, the instructors always do something nice, whether it's a peppermint oil-infused little shoulder rub and strategically placed pressure point finishing touch or a scented eye mask.

The prices are standard for CC, but I find them a bit high. I suppose if you don't have a regular gym membership and this is your only means of exercise/relaxation, one can justify the price, but since I am doing this as part of my prenatal care, I was grateful to find a groupon that made it doable. 

Note: There's no water fountain, so bring your own water. They do sell Dasani at the studio.

Special Note: They do allow for a week of free classes to try the studio out!

Also, there's a Starbucks right across the street and Whole Foods is next door, so if you need to run a few errands or wait on a ride, there are a couple of nice options.

0,"Basic Spice is a nice, cozy place located in the South Grand area.  The staff are extremely friendly.  We even received a free order of spring rolls, which was nice.  The dumplings were also quite delicious.  

I am a coconut milk and curry fan and went for the Gang Dang (w/chicken), which was chocked full of various veggies and very tasty.  They also actually ask what heat level you prefer as far as the curry is concerned, which is an added plus considering some establishments do not.  The prices are a little steep but quality makes up for the added cost.  I will return to try another delicious curry entree in the near future!","The burgers are Village Whiskey are perhaps some of the best in the city.

A lot of people rave about the duck fat fries with the sly fox dipping sauce, but I think they're just alright...nothing too special about them.  Most recently, my BF got the Kentucky Hot Brown, which is not really a sandwich, but more of a delicious cast iron skillet full of delicious cheese sauce, turkey, and some sort of bread that is like a pancake, but not soggy.  I may have to defect from ordering my burger and switch over to that next time.  

Drinks are pricey, but well worth it.  The bee charmer is my favorite drink on the menu - I've never seen another like it in my drinking career (lavender/chamomile infused gin, yellow chartreuse, lemon, & honey).  If you're a fan of whiskey/bourbon/rye/scotch, this place is for you!

My biggest complaint about the Village Whiskey in Philadelphia is that it's REALLY small inside, so if you have a big party (like 5+), don't even bother.  Even a party of three is usually squished in to a little table.  You'll have more luck getting a (comfortable) seat if it's nice and you can sit outside.

1,"Maybe it's because I am a frequent diner of Korean cuisine, but all this place seemed like to me was overpriced Korean fusion food in a ""hip"" setting. Honestly, if you don't eat Korean food EVER then this place will be AMAZING to you. The place is clean and sleek, the chicken wings are bomb, and bibimbap is not an item that is easily accessible in center city. But if you are like me and regularly eat Korean food, $2 per wing, $3 for fermented cabbage that usually comes free, and ~$15 for a bowl of rice and veggies in a stone bowl are just not worth it.
On the plus side, at least this place is helping Korean food become more mainstream.","Something I wish I had known prior to arriving here (which is super helpful to know) is that the non-pizza items here are somewhat tapas style. So that being said, this place ends up being somewhat pricier than you would think. We ended up ordering about 10 different ~$15 plates and 1 pizza for 4 people. We weren't planning on spending that much when initially looking at the menu online, but still glad we came because everything was amazing!

I drove by this place a million times on my commute along Kelly drive, and finally decided to give this place a try. I must say, everything was better than I expected it to be! We needed to order some veggie options so I reluctantly agreed to getting the pea ravioli... which actually blew my mind! Salads are fresh, flavors are incredible, and textures of all pasta and meat are perfect. You can pretty much order anything on the menu here and you will be happy...

Mostly I came here for beer, they have a decent selection and thier prices are not too high. I like a place where you can buy fancier microbrews and colt 45 in the same place.

Came here this past weekend and ate dinner, tried a  vegan pulled pork sandwich with fried green tomatoes with side of collards, sandwich was really good, the collards were a little bland for me.

1. Good beer selection/everything drink selection
2. Generally great screens
3. Great seating options
4. Super fast food
5. Decent parking in the back.

However, there are major draw backs that makes this a place a I rather not go to unless I have to, but I will happily go to if friends make me go here:

1. The food is overly salty and seasoned like you won't believe...
2. Servers bust their butt, but on busy nights, there just aren't enough of them. Or even on slow, nights, there still aren't enough. Poor people management is one of my biggest pet peeves.
3. They are actually kinda rude to smaller groups. I understand you want to make money, but reservations are reservations.
4. Granted there are a lot of good things on the menu, the overall quality of them is average to slightly above average at best.

The place is a little odd inside. Only a few tables to sit at. It's never busy when we go, so we've always had a table. 

I've met the owner and he is from Jordan. His background is probably the reason this place is a little different than the usual Greek inspired Mediterranean establishments.

Get the Plato's Delight appetizer, which is edamame, corn, garlic, and red pepper sautéed in white wine and spices, drizzled with tahini sauce. It's amazing!

I usually get the duo plate with chicken and gyro meat. The gyro meat here always melts in your mouth. So good!

They avoid the potential pitfall of inadequate heating on the buffet line, and for an additional buck, you can add a side of naan. 

I have frequently pointed people in Mumbai's direction not only because of the food quality, but also because of the unbeatable prices. Not to be the eternal pessimist, but this is not the best Indian food in Philly. It's the best price, without question, and the service is always friendly; however, there are some other options worth considering if you want top-notch Tikka Masala and other Westernized curry dishes. 

Mumbai Bistro is definitely deserving of a 4-star review and while there may be nicer Indian restaurants in the city, few could compete with its accessibility. For those working in Center City, this is a staple.","Diamond in the rough. That's all that can be said about this chaat-catering, strangely delicious, unbelievably friendly environment. For the sake of full disclosure, my taste buds were certainly adjusting to chaat as I was at Mood. It's a strange sensation: the mixing of the hot veggies and meat, the cold yogurt, the crispy wonton shells - all of it crunched up in a bowl. 

Hasan, the owner and one of the friendliest faces in all of Philadelphia, explained every step of how he prepares and serves the food. Then, for dessert, he prepared a carrot and cream cheese dish, with hot, stewed carrots (naturally sweet) and homemade cheese. It was somehow similar to a pumpkin or sweet potato pastry. 

Like other reviewers's experience, I too was blown away by both Hasan's kindness and his restaurant. He remembers faces well, and will prepare you a different kind of dish every time you visit. He promised a different, hot rice and beans dish next time I came. He also assured my girlfriend and I that we would not have to pay if we didn't like the food.

We arrived about 5 minutes before our quoted tone and checked in at the station. They said it would be another 10 minutes. We were fine with that so waited. We watched one family come in and get several bags of peanuts and at least 5 baskets of rolls. They were sitting outside chowing down!  After 30 minutes passed I finally asked how much longer. I saw people who checked in after us being sat before us. They had skipped over us but said it would be soon. We had to toddlers in our party door was getting a bit ridiculous waiting so long. Finally we sat and our server was decent. We ordered margaritas and the blooming onion style appetizer. The drinks were good, the onion was terrible! Even the sauce was bad, no one really ate much of it. We then ordered chicken for the kids and the rest of us had steaks. My steak was very rare when ordered medium. They were able to fix it pretty quick. Of course it came out closer to well that time but  at least it wasn't bleeding still. The flavor was delicious. Our bill was $130 so not too bad for a part of 7. It was only 4 adult meals, we all had 6 ounce sirloin and it was very tender.  We did have issues getting drunk refills but it was busy.

Hopefully they can be more prompt with their seating & service.","Look, I get it - this is ""Mexican"" fast food.  But it shouldn't be so fast to where the meat is Pittsburgh rare.

I ordered a steak taco salad and when I sat down to eat it, I could of sworn I heard cows moo-ing at me.  The steak was blood red.  Now, I'm not a picky eater, and I adore meat being a bit red (medium is perfect).  However, when bite-size pieces of steak are not cooked through, I quickly lose my appetite.  

I ended up chucking most of the salad in the trash for fear of getting sick from the uncooked meat.  I know, many people eat rare meat, but you know what? I don't. It's just a phobia I have.  So why is Qdoba cooking their steaks rare?

Perhaps it was just a lunch-rush fluke on that day.  I've had other things there that were decent, so perhaps I'll give them another go.  But I won't order the steak.","Text1: We have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. We live about 30 minutes away so called ahead for seating. We were told 65 minutes. We arrived about 5 minutes before our quoted tone and checked in at the station. They said it would be another 10 minutes. We were fine with that so waited. We watched one family come in and get several bags of peanuts and at least 5 baskets of rolls. They were sitting outside chowing down!  After 30 minutes passed I finally asked how much longer. I saw people who checked in after us being sat before us. They had skipped over us but said it would be soon. We had to toddlers in our party door was getting a bit ridiculous waiting so long. Finally we sat and our server was decent. We ordered margaritas and the blooming onion style appetizer. The drinks were good, the onion was terrible! Even the sauce was bad, no one really ate much of it. We then ordered chicken for the kids and the rest of us had steaks. My steak was very rare when ordered medium. They were able to fix it pretty quick. Of course it came out closer to well that time but  at least it wasn't bleeding still. The flavor was delicious. Our bill was $130 so not too bad for a part of 7. It was only 4 adult meals, we all had 6 ounce sirloin and it was very tender.  We did have issues getting drunk refills but it was busy. We asked 3-5 times before drinks really showed up. We will try them again on a not so busy night. Hopefully they can be more prompt with their seating & service.

0,"This is the best place to get soondoobu in the Philadelphia area. (Still, as great as this place is, I still yearn for a BCD tofu house in Philadelphia.) 

The service, although somewhat rude (is it just me since I'm a college student? or is that lady always frowning and hating life?), always brings out the food very quickly. Soondubu is always boiling hot, delicious, and filling here, although they do use MSG. My favorite is the pork soondoobu (I think a new addition), but I also love the seafood, mushroom, and kimchi soondubu as well.

Our party of five was seated right away and coffee was served quickly.

I had no complaints about my Western Omelet and my daughter and my mom both enjoyed the Spanish Omelet.  My stepdad had the Country Omelet (I think that's what it was called) and my husband had a platter with eggs, home fries, pancakes, sausage and bacon.  We had no problems whatsoever with the food - it was right up to par with other diners/breakfast joints.

0,"Definitely one of the best meals I have had in St. Louis.

First of all, the place clearly proclaims that it is a bar.  it is a bar in the center of the room with some tables around the perimeter of the room  But it is a bar with fabulous food, because all the food is cooked in Tony's kitchen.  

The servers act as both bartenders and waiters, and it is intriguing to watch them work the room.  It is old world service, without the stuffiness of Tony's.

My dinner: a wonderful tomato and watermelon salad, ziti with rock shrimp, chocolate coconut tart.  All of it superb.

Note that the place is inside the United Missouri Bank Building.  You enter from the lobby, not from the outside.","The lovely wife and I were Living the Dream!

1. We were on our way to a new place my fellow Yelpers were raving about.
2. Cambodian was a new ethnicity for us. Very exciting!
3. It was BYOB which we always appreciate.
4. On our first pass we snagged a parking spot less than a block away. Very lucky in this crowded part of South Philly.
5. We walked in to this tiny cozy place at 3 PM on a Sunday and snagged a table right away.

Everything was going so well it was time for a bump in the road. The first thing our very pleasant waiter did was list the seven items, that's right seven items, which they were out of.  This included all the skewers and several other dishes. The carnivore in me was completely ready for those beautiful sticks of meat and I was to be denied.

It turns out that they were slammed on Friday and Saturday and this was the result. Also, it's happened before. LESSON LEARNED- Sunday afternoon maybe great for snagging a table but bad for availability of menu items!

So with limited choices available we picked PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH ($8) as our appetizer. It was delicious and a perfect way to begin our meal. Some folks may think that dipping raw vegetables into a meat sauce is a little odd but trust me, it works.

For our meal we decided to split two dishes. The first was PLEAH SACH-KHOE. This was delicious marinated beef with kaffir lime and lemongrass. It was so good it was beyond five stars for both of us.

We also devoured a CHICKEN CURRY STEW that was incredible. The texture and layers of flavor in the broth brought smiles to both of our faces.

The wife and I both love this place and we'll be back but not on a Sunday afternoon.  We understand it's tiny and family run but seven items off the small menu was a big disappointment.

0,"The Howlin Wolf is a cool venue to see a show. Plus there is a separate bar called The Den for food and drinks.

I had been to this venue before it was the Howling Wolf (Praline connection maybe?). Like many things in New Orleans, time has not changed it much, if at all.

The venue is a large open room with a bar along the back wall. The stage is large and has two New Orleans type porches on the side. While they don't do much for a concert, they would probably add ambiance to a private event.

The staff were friendly and regardless of where we were, we had a good view of the stage. The bathrooms were pretty nasty, but they were acceptable.

The Den is a great place to get drinks or food prior to a show. While I didn't have food, I've been told it is very good. Drink prices were reasonable and their beer selection was better than other venues I've been to.

I like this venue and look forward to attending more events here.","I really liked this hotel.  The staff are pleasant and the grounds are kept up nicely.  Our room was very nice and comfortable w/ a nice view of the fountain.  They offer a brakfast in the morning w/ several good options.  My husband says that he wishes that they would just offer eggs sometimes...just plain eggs w/o the add ins.  But, they have cereal, oatmeal, fruit, toast, bagels, muffins, real waffles (not the conveyor belt pancakes), coffee, tea, cocoa and juices.  There is a nice excercise room w/ treadmill, elliptical, weights, kettle balls, yoga ball, weighted balls.  There is also an outside pool.","Text1: The Howlin Wolf is a cool venue to see a show.

The second one I had was just Meh..... I was kind of disappointed. I have been here several times and I cannot seem to get a consistent product. A donut that is fresh and yummy one day is dry and bland another. 

The service moves at a moderate pace. The first visit, the place was packed and it took a while. The second time, the place was empty and the service took even longer. They were almost out of coffee and gave us three half filled cups of warm coffee. It tasted old. If you have brew, right on your sign, shouldn't you have fresh coffee at all times? Just saying.

I have tried the sliders, and they are very tasty with quality ingredients, but they are a bit pricey.  This place is often a madhouse with horrible parking, but I continue to go back.

I am a coconut milk and curry fan and went for the Gang Dang (w/chicken), which was chocked full of various veggies and very tasty.

I recently went with some friends here for weekday lunch. We had a nice table by the front window overlooking St. Charles. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. 

I had the Almond Chicken Salad. It was a huge plate of food! Seemed like enough for 2-3 meals. Two of my friends ordered the Fried Chicken with Red Beans, which was excellent. Our fourth friend got the Honey Island Chicken Sandwich. It looked huge!

We had just eaten beforehand so we did not get any of the pastries, but they looked delicious.

One of Norman's classic principles of design was the concept of consistency - P.F. Chang's China Bistro, amongst a few other notable national chains, certainly delivers on this front.  The food is always very good with the veggie lettuce wraps (always a no brainer), eggplant in garlic sauce (also very good), ma po tofu (must I keep going with the compliments), and banana spring rolls rounding up the veggie components of our family-style dinner.  (Although I did want it all for myself...)

This was the first time that I felt really special in a P.F. Chang's location, and 100% of the credit here goes to our server, Paul.  He was very good with suggestions for the first-timers, and all in all, definitely helped make our experience as special as it was.

Long story short, great food, great service, great ambiance - a must visit.","I don't know that I have a whole lot to say about India's Kitchen, except that it was a decent dinner.  Now don't take it to mean that I'm not giving praise.  After all, 3 stars does mean ""A-OK.""  But at the same time, I've eaten at a number of other Indian food restaurants that are as good or better.

For our visit, we shared a vegetable appetizer.  That was pretty good.  A nice variety of breaded & fried vegetable-based items, all ot and with generous ingredient quantity.  The rice for our entrees was good - delicate flavor and not sticky - like it should be.  My wife enjoyed here chicken tikka masala, and my daughter enjoyed her chicken mango.  I will shout out that the chicken in the chicken mango was extremely tender - but still firm and flavorful.  My goat curry had a good, typical flavor.  However, the volume of goat seemed a little skimpy when it arrived.  And it was more than 50% bone, meaning that I was left a little hungry.  That shouldn't happen.  The final item we ordered was naan for each of us.  The naan was excellent (I really like naan bread in general), but that is the case at most places.

the visit was enjoyable.  I'd go back again.  But I'm not of the opinion that this is the Indian restaurant that has to be near the top of my list.","Text1: Typical (awesome) P.F. Chang's food and atmosphere, fantastic service.

1,Robbi is all things leather! An expert & extraordinary crafter at best. Thanks Robbi,"From the moment I walked in it was apparent that this place was owned and operated by some really rad people! I bet really rad people hangout here too.

I digress, Whisk has been on my radar for quite some time. I've experienced their delicious products via other local establishments in the area such as Rise and Kitchen Coffee House. Today I was feeling froggy so I jumped on the first item the super helpful employee suggested; Salted Caramel Brownie Pie! Took one bite and literally drifted off to heaven. This was an amazing concoction of 2 soft baked brownie cookies with a light-airy salted caramel filling that formed a mouthwatering mini pie. 

The pastry case had so much unique goodness to choose from...gooey butter, popcorn and ginger cookies, gigantic brownies, lemon curd pop tarts, caramelized onion & asiago scones, vegan cupcakes, gluten-free banana chocolate chip muffins and so much more you'll have to go see for yourself because I'm not running the entire menu here.

Now on to the cool fixtures and furnishings. I loved the leather sofa perfectly positioned at the floor to ceiling window which offers a great view of Cherokee Row. There were world globes serving as tabletop centerpieces which I found extremely attractive as not only a traveler but a lover of globes. The walls were adorned with some of the most rad articles which can make wonderful conversations pieces.  I walked around the place, taking pics and engaging in conversation with two adorably pleasant young ladies sitting at one of the tables. Only to find out one was the owner.

1,"Mostly I come here because of the movie theater.

Sometimes I come here to shop.

Once in awhile I come here to eat.

Rarely do I combine two of the above activities here at the Summit, but it's pretty dead handy when I do.  My favorite stores are the Apple and Old Navy stores.  I love the little doggie park and the mini putt putt green they have at that end of the mall. Just a nice extra thoughtful touch.

Unlike other people, I am not one of those people who delight in leisurely walking from shop to shop, spending 45 minutes here, 25 minutes there, and dangling multiple shopping bags from my arm, leaving red marks on my skin.  

That is not my idea of fun; therefore the idea of walking from store to store doesn't bother me.  I tend to just go where I need to go, zero in on what I need to buy, and then get the heck out of there.

A blind 89 year old man in a wheelchair with only 1 arm to propel himself could outpace me, but I digress.

My friend Michael T, the Reno Yelp CRM, has been on my mind lately as I've noticed a few places claiming to have the best roast pork sandwiches in Philly.  Thought I'd give this place a shot and I'm glad I did. It's a tiny tiny divey shop, obviously run by a tight knit gang who have to juggle doing everything within 6 inches of each other.

My sandwich was promptly delivered to me 3 minutes after I ordered it. I sat on the tiny counter on a tiny stool and ate my giant sandwich which was around $7.  It could've been 2 meals! Of course, I loved the bread and the juicy pork dripping with flavor.

Thought I'd give this place a shot and I'm glad I did. It's a tiny tiny divey shop, obviously run by a tight knit gang who have to juggle doing everything within 6 inches of each other.

My sandwich was promptly delivered to me 3 minutes after I ordered it. I sat on the tiny counter on a tiny stool and ate my giant sandwich which was around $7.  It could've been 2 meals! Of course, I loved the bread and the juicy pork dripping with flavor. Skipped the rabe (sorry!) and shoulda added provolone cheese, but a girl's gotta watch her already curvy curves.",yes

Yes, it's super cluttered and it's set up in individual booths and getting someone with the right key to the right case can be a bit challenging. But if you find the exact pitcher you used to use in your grandmother's kitchen for about $20, then it's worth it.

I hate that you have to check your bags...but browsers aren't always honest so I get it.  Although I would say this is not the place to go if you have major dust allergies, but you already knew that.","After reading all my friends' 5 star reviews, I was expecting to be wowed, but the drinks I tasted (during Tales so maybe they were overworked?) were all way too sour. We had the classic Mai Tai, a Hurricane and ...something smokey tasting. The hurricane was actually the best of the drinks. The mai tai was so sour that it tasted more like a margarita, definitely not what I was expecting. 

As for the atmosphere, it's very warehouse-y with a bunch of decorations slapped around. And while there was table service, they were a bit overwhelmed while I was there. The prices are good for the size of the drinks.

Maybe I just need to go back when it's not Tales.","Text1: Looking for a treasure? Or a questionable collectible? Or maybe an Infant of Prague statue? Or even a vintage Mr. Bingle? This might be the store for you.

We got there around 2 after a horrible time at the DMV and were warmly greeted by the host, who sat us almost immediately. Once we sat down we both already knew what we wanted: a burger with all the trimmings, and top it with some onions, cheddar and bacon please! We also ordered the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce.

After placing our orders our waiter quickly brought us our drinks: I got the philadelphia punch which was apricot brandy and tea,, with some other delightful ingredients. And my boyfriend got an old fashioned. His was a lot stronger than mine by definition, but I was so pleased with both of our drinks. Mine was sweet but not overwhelming, and his was tart and smacks you in the face with some liqour. Exactly what we both wanted.

Once our burgers came we both dove right in. You have to flatten your burger cause it's such a fat patty. I stupidly ate the bread first and saved the burger for last cause in my mine, I'm thinking, ""save the best for last!"" But I was so full I had a couple bites left of delicious meat on my plate. Burgers were juicy and the carmelized onions were sweet and a perfect compliment to the bacon. 

The duck fat fries with the cheese sauce were also perfect! Just the right amount of salt and thickness to the fries, and the cheese sauce was like magic.

Little known tip for the future customer: eat the bread side last, and make sure you have plenty of napkins. You'll be having burger juice run down your chin and not feel bad about it.",my mouth waters when i think of the yummy food they serve. love the all you can eat buffet.,"Text1: This place was seriously delicious!

1,"First off let me just say I am a little late with my review of Pi, however I have been a regular since they first opened.

Have you ever had a place in your town that you are actually proud of and love recommending to friends and family, well Pi is that place for me. Ever since they first opened I have been a huge fan of their cornmeal deep dish crust pizza, it is ever so sweet without being too much. The toppings are another thing entirely, high quality toppings on top of their thick/chunky tomato sauce. I have to admit however I am not a fan of tomatoes, yet this sauce is amazing. It all comes together perfectly for an amazing pizza that is far superior to the Chicago style deep dish pizza. Next is the thin cruise which is just as good, however it uses a slightly different sauce, but is equally as good.

The atmosphere at each pie is very unique and casual while somehow maintaining an intimate experience. I love this place, amazing pizza and an atmosphere to match.","I have been by Donut Drive-In a number of times and I always am tempted to stop by because their donuts are just that good. First off their hours are amazing, so if you ever get a late evening/night craving for a donut they are at least 10:30 Wednesday-Saturday and even stay open till midnight on Friday and Saturday nights.  The best part is that they are making donuts whenever you stop by, so you can always get a freshly made donut. There is something about getting a donut that was just dipped in chocolate icing, its amazing. The dough is light and airy while the icing is sweet but not too sweet or rich. Prices are fair, and you can often find people stopping by for a quick snack on the way home or even people stopping in  after dinner for a sweet treat. If you are in the City this is a must do.","Text1: First off let me just say I am a little late with my review of Pi, however I have been a regular since they first opened.

The decor is really lack luster and honestly nothing about the place seemed to stand out other than it was ""slow.""   I assume that people also eat there since there are tables but when I was there it was pretty much just a few other people at the bar other than my group.   The fried pickles came out pretty quickly after we ordered them and they were pretty tasty ( but I've haven't met a bad fried pickle yet!) and the sauce it came with was good.  I feel like it was thousand island dressing.   So the paper that was below the pickles was saturated with oil and when went to pick up the paper to see how bad it was under there on the plastic basket, the basket was DIRTY.  It had neon yellow gritty stuff all over it, and it definitely was not supposed to look like that.  Needless to say, pickles aside, I wasn't impressed.","How on earth did a review slip by me the first (two) times?  For shame!  I love this place.  Love it.  They are within striking distance from home and a nice addition to the arsenal of eateries on South Grand.  Oh where to begin...

The layout is very cool and presents patrons with a lovely ambiance.  It's not too loud or bright - at least when I have visited, and the staff is always very friendly.  They usually have you situated and beveraged within minutes.

Let's talk about the sweet, sweet tapas menu.  If one is questioning which tapas to partake in....let me guide you.  

These are my top 3..
1.  Bleu Cheese Stuffed, Applewood Smoked Bacon Wrapped Dates - if dining for two...order at least two of these amazing lil' nuggets.  You will thank me for it later.  I dream about these when I am not dining at Mojo.
2.  Beer Battered Grouper Bites w/Mustard Malt Vinegar Aioli.  They will make love to your mouth with every bite....seriously.
3.  New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp.  The name alone should suffice....delicious and fiery.  

I also thoroughly enjoyed the baked goat cheese with creole sauce & bread and the roasted veggie cakes.  There are so many others I intend to try, but I can never pull myself away from the top three.

Drinks...sweet Jesus...their mojitos will own you.  The mint mojito is amazing.  They also offer a lemon basil version if that floats your boat.  The sangria is also equally refreshing a well.  If you are feeling funky, they also have 1/2 price pitcher nights for margaritas (Monday), sangria (Tuesday), and mojitos (Thursday).  One can never beat half price pitchers of refreshing and delicious cocktails.

If you have always wanted to venture out and take your virginal tapas plunge - Mojo is a great place for it.  They are easy on the pocketbook and go above and beyond when it comes to quality and service.  The best part is you won't go away overstuffed and feeling gross nor will you go away hungry.

Whether you're a vegetarian/vegan or carnivore... you have to admit this meat-free burger is simply delicious.

I suggest you stop the fucking comparison to authentic whatever style, go inside, sit and relax at the bar with a beer, and talk to the folks around while you wait. It's not some crappy chain, so it takes time. Great robust, spicy sauce, lots of whole milk mozzarella, and fresh toppings. It tastes nothing like Domino's, as someone from Chicago reported. (Probably a Cubs fan, so you know their taste can't be relied upon.)","So my friend came in from out of town and wanted to go here, and I was a little apprehensive based on the reviews about service, but I was not disappointed.

Wasabi Fries (too much for 2 people, but good for 3-4 to share)
Tuna Flower (good to share for 2-3)
Tokyo Maki (spicier than I expected!)

With so many reviews, there's little left to be said.  

Things I love: 
Homemade soy sauce (less sodium!)
Sukiyaki (not ridiculously sweet, surprisingly it's been Americanized to DECREASE its sugar content!)

I will definitely be returning, but it might not be too soon since the specials put a larger dent in the wallet than I anticipated and I can't get the Beatles out of my head yet.","Good news for wine, beer and cheese lovers...tria is multiplying!

Third Degree has a variety of hand blown glass pieces made by several St Louis Artists. Ornaments, vases, bowls, glasses, and many other things that you decide you must have as soon as you see them out. The artists constantly make a variety of different pieces so if you don't see something you like the first time you go, come back another time.  There are always new pieces that might just pique your interest.

Also, if you're ever looking for something to do on a Friday evening, you should stop by the factory.  (Just make sure it's the Third Friday of the month). Check out their amazing open house (there is a link for them under Yelp Events if you're curious). You'll get to see demonstrations of the artists' work as well as look at all the new things they have made in the past month. While you are at it, you can also sign up for one of their workshops on making ornaments, beads, or paperweights - take home a little souvenir of your experience. Just a heads up, you may want to dress in layers. The hot shop may occasionally get extremely hot - I have found a few times in the summer I can't even sit there in jeans. 

I've heard the factory is a great place for events and venues, but did you also know they have glassblowing lessons?  That's right, you can learn how to make those one of a kind creations you see them selling.  Well, sort of learn... It takes a lifetime to master, but you would really be impressed with how much better you can get by the end of a semester. I took a series of glassblowing classes here through Wash U and loved it! Jon was my amazing instructor, and I highly recommend any of his classes. I am sure the other instructors are great too, but if I took another series here, I'd make sure Jon taught them. Glassblowing is a lot tougher than these masters make it appear. I can't tell you how many times I have messed up, but Jon really makes every student feel comfortable.  One thing I truly appreciate is his patience and flexibility. As beginners, it is very difficult to be able to deviate from your original plan, especially when something severely goes wrong and you cannot continue how you had intended.  Anytime a piece didn't come out quite right, Jon had an incredible amount of patience, foresight, and ingenuity to help us turn them into masterpieces we would love. (I am using the term masterpiece very very loosely here.  But if you compared the original to the final work, you'd understand why)  Examples? Lopsided, unusable cups into beautiful, decorative wavy bowls. Fat, overweight ornaments into delicate, impressive vases.  Destroyed, impractical bowls into useful paperweights.   My favorite part of the class?  Getting my own collection of handblown glass pieces that I made with my blood, sweat, and tears.

0,"I love me some Cheeseburger In Paradise.  
CIP's menu suits my taste buds very well.  There are many things that sound good.. but I almost always get the same thing.  The Jerk chicken wrap with sweet potato chips.  Occasionally, my stomach will come calling for some dill pickle chips too.  

The atmosphere for those who haven't been is 'Paradise', but not over the top tacky like some other places.  They have a tiki bar in the middle for your drinking needs with some TV's and such.  There is a good amount of room within the restaurant with a nice area by the patio for larger parties. We've never had a problem with service. They do get bogged down at times, but always take care of us.  

They have a decent mixed drink menu, but I think their beer selection is one of the things that is really lacking.  I'd love to see this beefed up a bit with some more Caribbean flavors and choices.  

The food is great.  In my opinion the quality is very good for the price.  I love the jerk chicken wrap as its something you don't see many other places (I would like to see a grilled jerk chicken wrap).","Lüke is a magical place that manages something few restaurants in New Orleans have come close to: taking me away. 

When I walk through those revolving doors, I'm whisked back to my beloved Philadelphia. The European influence is evident on this menu, and I feel like Chef Besh captured the essence of what a cuisine does as it mutates over the years. He just skipped the 50 years it would take for his menu to evolve by being chef-smart and pulling it together. 

Others have complained about the beer and wine in odd glassware, but it somehow suits the restaurant. I feel like I should bring my grandfather here for lunch. Retired lawyers and doctors and high-powered business people would spend their morning here, reading papers and sipping a beer and chatting. Lüke feels like the Galatoire's for a different class of people. 

I've eaten at Lüke a couple ways: straight dinner, just apps, and a mixed meal. The very best decision I made was P&J oysters (a dozen for $13!), the poached yard-egg salad sans bacon (oddly filling), and a slice of Black Forest inspired cake (rich, creamy, heavy with Chantilly cream). The oysters here are always delish, and the price of the local oysters (P&J, for those not in the know) is really competitive for a restaurant in the CBD. 

If Lüke is my magical fantasyland of a restaurant, why only three stars?
Le sigh. 
Say it with me: the service.  

The first time my lady and I came, our server looked like she was on speed or something. She was spacy and wired and jumpy without ever making eye contact. Of course we had a chat with the manager. I honestly thought it was a fluke because there were three other servers working the back room (where we sat) that were amazingly attentive and charming. 

Then I jump on Yelp and see that everyone else hates the service. But...but...but I love Lüke! I don't want to hate Lüke! This is my little oasis in all of New Orleans! Am I deluded? 

So I visit again. Similar experience. 

And the third visit is really what sealed my review. 
I came on a Sunday night after work. I sat at the bar with my Kindle. There were two bartenders, hopping around Doing Important Things™. Between making drinks, gossiping with waiters, avoiding the managers, and running back to the kitchen, I sat for 20 minutes before anyone greeted me. Then the really surly bartender threw my menu at me as she walked past. That was surprising. The rest of my meal unfolded in similar, odd fashion with long periods of being ignored followed by rushed service. Having to defend my plate of oysters kept me amused which was good because I probably would have lost it and snapped at someone after the 4th attempt to remove them before I was finished AS I WAS SLURPING. It was like a game, only I would always be the loser. The food runners who brought my salad and my dessert didn't speak to me when they set the food down, but I don't think I can fault them on that. I was obviously reading. It was clear that I was busy so I think they were trying to respect that. 

That dinner took two hours; to say it borders on excessive for one person, seated at the bar, with no cooked food is an understatement. 

I think I'll keep coming to Lüke, but my expectations have shifted. (I'm getting so much better at managing my disappointment.) Lüke, if you ever shape up, I'll call you like that proverbial ex-boyfriend who promises to join the Army and get things together. 

Accessibility notes: Revolving door at entrance is not automatic. Restaurant gets very loud at peak hours. Back half of restaurant is up several steps. No braille menu or signage.","Text1: I love me some Cheeseburger In Paradise.  
CIP's menu suits my taste buds very well.  There are many things that sound good.. but I almost always get the same thing.  The Jerk chicken wrap with sweet potato chips.  Occasionally, my stomach will come calling for some dill pickle chips too.  

The atmosphere for those who haven't been is 'Paradise', but not over the top tacky like some other places.  They have a tiki bar in the middle for your drinking needs with some TV's and such.  There is a good amount of room within the restaurant with a nice area by the patio for larger parties. We've never had a problem with service. They do get bogged down at times, but always take care of us.  

They have a decent mixed drink menu, but I think their beer selection is one of the things that is really lacking.  I'd love to see this beefed up a bit with some more Caribbean flavors and choices.  

The food is great.  In my opinion the quality is very good for the price.  I love the jerk chicken wrap as its something you don't see many other places (I would like to see a grilled jerk chicken wrap). 

 Text2: Lüke is a magical place that manages something few restaurants in New Orleans have come close to: taking me away. 

When I walk through those revolving doors, I'm whisked back to my beloved Philadelphia. The European influence is evident on this menu, and I feel like Chef Besh captured the essence of what a cuisine does as it mutates over the years. He just skipped the 50 years it would take for his menu to evolve by being chef-smart and pulling it together. 

Others have complained about the beer and wine in odd glassware, but it somehow suits the restaurant. I feel like I should bring my grandfather here for lunch. Retired lawyers and doctors and high-powered business people would spend their morning here, reading papers and sipping a beer and chatting. Lüke feels like the Galatoire's for a different class of people. 

I've eaten at Lüke a couple ways: straight dinner, just apps, and a mixed meal. The very best decision I made was P&J oysters (a dozen for $13!), the poached yard-egg salad sans bacon (oddly filling), and a slice of Black Forest inspired cake (rich, creamy, heavy with Chantilly cream). The oysters here are always delish, and the price of the local oysters (P&J, for those not in the know) is really competitive for a restaurant in the CBD. 

If Lüke is my magical fantasyland of a restaurant, why only three stars?

1,"Came in for the western omelet with hash browns, however upon canvassing the lunch specials menu, i found a very hard to pass up chicken - fried steak with potatoes for $8.25. So I said, 'why the hell not'? So that, accompanied with green beans and a side salad came up to $9.27 after tax. Scoring a meal for under ten dollars anywhere these days is a rare occurrence for me.

Inside definitely feels like a diner, but I will say, things were smelling pretty good. Could have been that i was athirst for nourishment,  but the nose rarely confuses.

Got everything back to my house and it was all very good, I was rather pleased with the meal. These days, I'm not much into eating until I feel pot-belly-full; the portions were adequate of that desire as well. The chicken was not super crispy like most chicken-fried steaks, but I'll say that's the case because I drove it from St. Charles Ave to Mid City, still good tho. I also asked for white gravy and got brown, but it didn't kill the deal.

I think I'll be back for that western omelet tho. I'm glad I finally came here, I'll be seeing them soon.","Back on my taco binge, I had to find a new place to get my fixing. I like this little place, a lot. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.

There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.

Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.

My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.

The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.

One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in ""the book"" and they would take care of it next time. Well folks, there is no ""the book"" so if it happens to you, don't fall for it. Get something written from management.

****UPDATE****
My date clarified that there IS in fact a book. My Apologies to any staff affected.

1,"I went to Fez for a birthday party. I had zero expectations and overall I had a great time. I went on a Saturday night, so the only option was the 7 course meal. The belly dancer was great and got the crowd involved. The drink prices were reasonable for the city. My only complaints were the super slow service. We arrived at 8:15. My husband and I left at 11:15 and the last hadn't been served yet. Of course this drove up our bar tab. Also as a morrocan newbie it would have been nice if someone explained the dishes.

I was in a group where peope didn't really know each other, so I know a few peopke felt uncomfortable eating with their hands though I absolutely loved that part. This was a unique dining experience.

I had to try it out. My friend and I went around 12:30. The restuarant was about half full and the manager greeted me at the door and showed me to my table. I ordered a mimosa and my friend joined a few minutes later and she ordered one as well. 

They were served in large wine glass. Light on the champagne, but very tasty. The four course brunch menu consisted of breads and pastries, yogurt, main course, and mini cupcakes. 

We received our bread and pastries. They were good, but similar to packaged bread and mini muffins. We have a couple and waited for the next course. They brought out yogurt with fresh blackberries, blueberries, and a sttrawberry, served in a cute martini glass. The yogurt didn't have a lot of flavor, but the fresh fruit was tasty. 

I ordered the mexican burrito served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were crispy to my liking. The burrito was large, but we noticed some of the ingradients were missing like the avocado cream and sour cream. We mentioned it to ther server and they brought it right out. The burrito was good, nothing to rave about. I was certainly full.

They brought out a plate of four mini cupcakes, but I was so full I wrapped them up for my kids at home. 

The food was average, service was good, but the drinks made it all worth it. I would go again, and maybe try their aparagus and goat cheese quiche next time. 

PS. I've been there for happy hour and I highly suggest trying the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. It's out of this world.","Text1: I went to Fez for a birthday party.

They've definitely been upgrading the space itself since I arrived on campus in 2003 and everything has certainly been for the better.

If you're with some people and you all want your own unique slice and perhaps a beverage with some alcohol stop in.","I'm really liking this place.

It's taken me forever to find a family practice doctor in Tucson. Any sort of specialty doctor I've needed I've had zero problem finding, but when it came to just a primary care physician it has seemed impossible.

Finally I came here. Dr. Sanders was the doctor I was able to see the soonest so I that is who I saw.

He's great! He's so so so nice. He listens to you, he answers questions, and he doesn't make you feel stupid for going to the doctor. His medical assistant is also really nice too. When I had a question about my prescription she called me back in just a few hours.

The first time I went I did wait forever. I can't blame them though, this seems to be a healthcare problem in general. The second time though I probably only waited 10 minutes.

I'm seriously so happy to finally have a doctor in Tucson, I'm just sad it almost took me a decade to accomplish.","Text1: I love this place. When I was in college I probably went here once a week.

Wednesday is 1/2 price boneless wings and Monday is the Shrimp deal.

Love to take my 6 year old here - as I, probably should not even contemplate eating this.  It's an OCCAISIONAL treat only.  And we get celery in lieu of fries - and I get a salad - so I feel a little less guilty.

Bring on the fried shrimp!
And corn dogs. (Big and slightly sweet batter.)  Umm!","A few lucky PWCG members took part in a share of delicious, sustainable salmon from  OTOLITH SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD in Philadelphia.  The 15 lbs of Salmon came in convenient (approx.) 1 lb portions.
 
With my first lb (I have gotten 3 lbs so far) here's what I made:
 
Karen Flam's ""Grilled Gravlax"".
 
Since I hadn't the time to do a proper ""cure"" here's what I did:
 
Dry-rub the clean, thawed salmon with:
 
1.5 tsp. Penzey's Shallot Salt
1 tsp. Penzey's Vanilla Sugar (yes, really)
A few healthy shakes of granulated Garlic
A few cracks of fresh black pepper
LOTS of fresh or dried dill.
 
Then, squeeze on the juice of one (or two) fresh lemons, or use 3-4 TBSP of bottled lemon juice.
 
Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4-6 hours (I couldn't wait any longer) - ideally - cure longer (and add some juniper berries - I didn;t have any).
 
Heat a skillet with 1-2 tsp of good olive oil and pan-grill (or use a real grill or grill pan).
I seared mine (First with skin side down, then flipped and seard the flesh side).
 
Slice thinly and serve.
 
Do not over cook!
 
My 6 year old gobbled up the small slice I gave her and asked for more right away.
She proceeded to eat about 4 oz!","Text1: So glad that Angela and the gang are still going strong after 2 years, delivering wings, ribs, corn dogs and FABULOUS fried shrimp to Drexel/Hahnemann students and others.

Wednesday is 1/2 price boneless wings and Monday is the Shrimp deal.

0,"Coral hooked it up with a $50 cut and color. At first I was sceptical about the price because as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for,"" but that wasn't the case.

There were hardly any patrons in the cafe and so we had the pick of the place. That is also concerning because I'm not sure if they have picked up enough buzz over the last few months. I don't know what I will do if they shut down....

Regardless it is still my favorite place so I'll operate under the ""more for me"" notion. Medi-salad + scoop of humus = Happy Sarah P. What can I say?

1,This place is everything you imagined. I can't believe I didn't submit my review. At the time I ate meat and I got miso lamb ramen. Omg!!! It was amazing. All those flavored bursting in your mouth. The wait wasn't bad at all. It's clean and friendly. I called ahead and ordered for take out and it was enjoyable.,"So I love tired hands so much I'm basically the dutchess of this place! They have amazing tap options & there's something for everyone to try. I've had the veggie burger, tacos, fries, pretzels, & of course I love all their dessert options!

On Friday & Saturday nights they do have a limited menu for the bar area and the table surrounding the bar so just mindful of that if don't want to wait 30-45 for a table in the main dining area. The hostess & most of the server I've encountered with are truly amazing. They are well educated on the taps to give you an idea of what you may have a taste for. My favorites are Hop Hands & Nothing! I love that I can get a 4 ounce especially because I'm not a huge fan of beer but these flavors are amazing! 

The place is clean & full of positive vibes. My only feedback is that there aren't too many people of color in this establishment as far as employees are concerned. I've literally only seen 1 at each of their location; so maybe a bit more diversity could attract a more diverse crowd but nonetheless I haven't had a bad experience here.","Text1: This place is everything you imagined.

0,"Such a Beautiful Hotel! I was only in the hotel to meet some friends at the W XYZ Bar, so I unfortunately did not experience the accommodations of their hotel rooms.

I love the modern contemporary look and the wide open snack bar which I was proud of myself that I was able to stay away. 

The only staff member we were greeted by was the valet, but he had no choice since he had to take my car to park it. Overall, he was very friendly. 

Valet Parking for overnight guests is $20 and for non-guests it is $10. However, of you spend $10 at the bar, your parking fee is only $5. You are able to pay for parking at the bar itself, and they will validate your ticket.  

We were never greeted ""Hello"" or ""Goodbye"" by the front desk attendant who seemed to be attending to her cell phone instead. 

I loved the beautiful pool area and would love to see it in the daytime.

I definitely plan on coming back in order to explore more of the hotel and possibly stay the night.","Stopped in here for lunch while completing my sandwich tour of Nashville (via ""TheCityPaper"") and tried the Italian Sausage Stuffed Pretzel.  I was very excited for this sandwich and the uniqueness of using a pretzel as a bun.  However, I was disappointed with the taste and overall presentation of the meal.  For starters, the pretzel dude at the amusement park can make a better pretzel that's warm, moist, slight crisp, and of course that delicious salt.  The pretzel here fell short as soggy and flavorless.  The cheese seemed to have been sitting on the burger as well.  Still, with all this the sandwich was OK (yes, just OK).

The waitstaff was very friendly, and even gave obliged on 1/2 price beers when there weren't any [a waitress informed us there was 2 for 1s, even though there weren't - but the manager still helped us out].  The atmosphere was decent as well with a nice patio.  The beer selection is just OK as well -- for a ""beer garden"" I'd expect them to have more.  

Given all the wonderful reviews of this place, I may just have to give it a second chance.","Text1: Such a Beautiful Hotel! I was only in the hotel to meet some friends at the W XYZ Bar, so I unfortunately did not experience the accommodations of their hotel rooms.

0,"Looking for a treasure? Or a questionable collectible? Or maybe an Infant of Prague statue? Or even a vintage Mr. Bingle? This might be the store for you. 

Yes, it's super cluttered and it's set up in individual booths and getting someone with the right key to the right case can be a bit challenging. But if you find the exact pitcher you used to use in your grandmother's kitchen for about $20, then it's worth it.

I hate that you have to check your bags...but browsers aren't always honest so I get it.  Although I would say this is not the place to go if you have major dust allergies, but you already knew that.","Paradise had been a long-awaited eatery in Tucson.....and while I was excited to try it out, unfortunately I was just wasn't wowed.  I'm not really sure what I was specifically expecting, but what I got was basically (in my humble opinion)sub-par cafeteria food at a high-end bistro price.

When we walked inside, there were tons of staff, but nobody really greeted us and/or instructed us on the ordering process (which counter to go to, where to get drinks, etc).  I ordered half of the turkey/cranberry ""Signature"" sandwich (more $$) and half of a Caesar salad while my husband chose half of a regular turkey sandwich and half of a chicken Caesar salad.  We also got two fountain drinks.  $22.  I didn't blink twice because they advertised ""molasses bread"" and I'm a sucker for anything turkey-cranberry related.

We found a booth (and the soda fountain, kind of hidden in the back) and when our food came, my face fell.  I could have made a better sandwich at home for less than half the price.  Nothing special about the bread, the meat was mechanically separated lunchmeat product and the cranberry was canned cranberry sauce that had so much water in it that it pooled onto the plate and ruined the bread.  Not impressed.  The tomatoes were flavorless and mealy (people, stop putting your 'maters in the fridge!) and the lettuce had definitely seen better days.

The salads were okay- the croutons were actually really good (and normally I hate croutons) but the chicken, again, was rubbery processed lunchmeat product.  Gross!  

On the plus side, lunch included a chocolate chip cookie, so that salvaged some of my experience.  I probably won't be back- for those prices I'd rather go to a local place and get fresher ingredients.","Text1: Looking for a treasure? Or a questionable collectible?

Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow.

Thanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a ""vegetable"" beer they offered--spot on.

I'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours.

A handful of specialty items---Cheech & Chong, Kiss and Lynard Skynard are just to name a few.  If you have any questions the staff really knows their stuff and are happy to help. Want a sample? You don't even have to ask because they have self-serve samples on wall displays.

There is a lot of parking, but its tricky turning into this complex.
Basically, you rent a lane ($12) and a recurve bow and 3 arrows ($6) and stay as long as you like. If it's your first time here, they will take you through a safety demonstration and access you for a left or right recurve bow. You will also be given a target sheet to hang at the end of the lane. You can shoot when everyone is at the shooting line and it's safe to do so.
The staff at Wyld Archery are very knowledgeable and are always helpful anytime you have a question. 
I didn't think I would like archery this much, but I started to really enjoy it after a few more times coming here. It has challenged me to be more focus and its also a very inspirational sport.
I decided to continue learning archery,  so I bought a 15 session pass. (Comes out to be $6 a session).
There are a lot of regulars that come here to target practice and many of them are always willing to help you and give you pointers if you ask. 
This is a very down to earth place and the people here are very easy going. You'll really enjoy doing archery here, especially for beginners.
It's a good focus exercise and you get to work on your shoulders as well.","This is a hard one. I was in the mood for lobster when I came here. I really wanted to fall in love with all the foods I tried. They were just fine, but didn't blow my mind.

I had the lobster chowdah...It was delish.

1,I haven't actually stayed at this hotel so the review I'm writing is based on special events I have attended alone.

The place is brand new, open less then two weeks. We were promptly seated, and the head brewer (and his wife) both popped over to say hello and walk us through the offerings. We got two flights of the ciders, although the craft offerings and wine options were all local and impressive. I thought all four were really well done, and would happily revisit any of them. The flavors were clean, its obvious that the ingredients are carefully selected, and the finished product is pretty masterful. I thought the Hale to the Hop almost drank more like a beer, the citra hops were a lovely and unique choice. The Lil Sunshine was very drinkable and really delicious, and the Standard was excellent as expected. I could have used a little more mango with the Sail Away, but thats a very nitpicky, minor complaint. The physical space is beautiful and clean, and the place is exquisite because it still is shiny and brand new. We complimented our ciders with two pastries, sold in compliment with a neighboring business. A very nice touch!

Awesome new spot, thanks for a great time!","to prepare for the arrival of hurricane sandy, i stopped by here to purchase some ceci e fava (roasted chickpeas and fava beans) in case i needed to resort to non-perishables. growing up on the gulf coast with hurricanes, i know what i will and will not eat if the electricity goes out. i've always loved roasted chickpeas and have made them myself on numerous occasions, but i didn't have the time and knew claudio's carried their own. the unit cost for 1 pound is 5.99usd, and i bought just shy of one pound. the beans were very good - mildly salty and crunchy - and of course, filling because of all the fiber. if i don't have time to make my own (which i actually prefer), i'll be sure to come back here to purchase claudio's version.","Text1: Was walking from a neighboring establishment on a drizzly Sunday that happened to be Mother's Day, and couldn't help but pop in and check it out. Man, am I glad we did! The place is brand new, open less then two weeks. We were promptly seated, and the head brewer (and his wife) both popped over to say hello and walk us through the offerings. We got two flights of the ciders, although the craft offerings and wine options were all local and impressive. I thought all four were really well done, and would happily revisit any of them. The flavors were clean, its obvious that the ingredients are carefully selected, and the finished product is pretty masterful. I thought the Hale to the Hop almost drank more like a beer, the citra hops were a lovely and unique choice. The Lil Sunshine was very drinkable and really delicious, and the Standard was excellent as expected. I could have used a little more mango with the Sail Away, but thats a very nitpicky, minor complaint. The physical space is beautiful and clean, and the place is exquisite because it still is shiny and brand new. We complimented our ciders with two pastries, sold in compliment with a neighboring business. A very nice touch!

This company has no idea what customer service is.","Crescent Park is just east of the French Market in the French Quarter. The promenade runs along the Mississippi River for 1.4 miles.

Made fresh so you can customize. Comes with hummus if you like and Mediterranean style pickles. 

Also got a Greek salad that I saved for later consumption. Kareem is a jokester and kept me laughing while taking order.

The space is well thought out, with plenty of room for coats and shoes, an organized area for props, and a welcoming entryway with lots of light. 

The staff are a happy, relaxed, wonderful bunch; all of them have that sincerely radiant demeanor that seems to occur only in yoga professionals and people who have just hiked the Appalachian Trail or something. I've taken a lot of classes with Robyn, whose sessions are challenging yet light-hearted. She always offers new perspectives and different ways to approach the postures, and she's great at reading the class's energy and building a practice to suit that moment.

With Whole Foods next door and Percy St. across the way, it's easy to keep yourself occupied around here. But when you're feeling the need to shrug off the busy city and turn your focus inward, Yoga Child is a lovely place to recharge.",tried them out for the first time at the night market last night...wanted to do the takoyaki but the line was wayyyy tooo long for that..so I ordered the curry burrito...wow not good at all...will give them another shot in the future.,"Text1: With cork floors, frosted glass and soft lighting, the studio here is absolutely serene - you can't help but feel a little more peaceful as soon as you walk in the door.

Attentive and friendly staff... and a great place to go with a group. Lots of fun! 

Highly recommended!","Had to stop by and eat, after reading all of the reviews. I had the General Tso's Chicken, and my girlfriends had the Kung Pao Chicken. Both were pretty good... especially after I added some chili oil to mine. Rice had been sitting in a steamer for too long, and was a bit mushy... but still edible. Also got a Scallion Pancake... and it was very good! Service was about what I expected, especially once they got a little busier. Nobody hovered... and a little patience and understanding helps... but the two girls were friendly and very helpful, when they did get to you!

1,"I love St Pete Beach. So do Stingrays. So make sure you do the Stingray Shuffle! The sand is soft on your feet and easy for them to hide in. Often times I have been here and dark cloud in the water approaches the beach. Tourists come screaming out of the water while locals run to it to try to keep the rays from landing. As long as you don't step on them, we can all live happily together but it is just easier to not have to worry about stepping on them. Sit quietly in the water and you might have one land at your feet. This absolutely excites me, I love being a native Floridian and have a lot of respect for my wildlife neighbors. Disclaimer : Its probably not best to try and pet a Stingray if your not sure how. Maybe visit the petting tank at the Florida aquarium before you try it in the wild. 

Another great thing about the St Pete...it is a long beach so even if it is crowded where you parked, or near your hotel, a walk down the beach will yield a less crowded place to land. 

Parking can be hard to find if you are not staying in one of the hotels on the beach. Because of this, the restaurants have to impose fees for parking until you produce a receipt that proves you were a customer.

It is family oriented and quite touristy. It is built up with a lot of hotels, restaurants and shops but that gives you a lot to do if you are here on vacation.","Four stars for consistently good food and a kitchen who will work with you. The result is a good meal exactly how you want it. 

This small Italian restaurant is located in a strip mall in North Riverview. Its not impressive on the outside and not super fancy, but it is clean and cute. They did a good job decorating the inside. The tile work on and behind the bar is beautiful. 
The kitchen is very small, you can see the cooks from your table so you will have to have patience on busy nights. The good news is that since each dish is prepared to order, you can change things up a bit if you want to to make any dish exactly what you are craving.  

The prices are comparable or even cheaper then most chain Italian restaurants, and the food is better so why would you go to a chain restaurant when you can get great Italian food from an Italian family Kitchen?","Text1: I love St Pete Beach.

After all, 3 stars does mean ""A-OK.""  But at the same time, I've eaten at a number of other Indian food restaurants that are as good or better.

For our visit, we shared a vegetable appetizer.  That was pretty good.  A nice variety of breaded & fried vegetable-based items, all ot and with generous ingredient quantity.  The rice for our entrees was good - delicate flavor and not sticky - like it should be.  My wife enjoyed here chicken tikka masala, and my daughter enjoyed her chicken mango.  I will shout out that the chicken in the chicken mango was extremely tender - but still firm and flavorful.  My goat curry had a good, typical flavor.  However, the volume of goat seemed a little skimpy when it arrived.  And it was more than 50% bone, meaning that I was left a little hungry.  That shouldn't happen.  The final item we ordered was naan for each of us.  The naan was excellent (I really like naan bread in general), but that is the case at most places.

the visit was enjoyable.  I'd go back again.  But I'm not of the opinion that this is the Indian restaurant that has to be near the top of my list.","Coral hooked it up with a $50 cut and color. At first I was sceptical about the price because as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for,"" but that wasn't the case. I knew of Coral when she was at Sinful Salon and she always did a great job. I did blonde bangs and burgundy for the rest. My hair came out phenomenal! I get so many compliments on it. My ends were really damaged from all the coloring I do so sadly she had to cut them off, but she offers a product for hair growth or eyelash growth of you want longer eyelashes. Their prices are VERY fair. The also do nails, make up and eye brows. Highly recommend you going in to see Coral for your hair needs!

The ONLY reason why I am hesitant to give this place 5 stars is due to it being basically ""family dining"". they have a fairly large dining room , and during happy hour you are most likely to catch a family in back with a couple of kids making noise and well it's slightly disturbing to toss back 5 martinis with a kid watching you...though I am usually against most kid places this one I sort of don't mind. I am certain yo won't see a folks with 4 kids in there past 8:30 at night!!!","Given the chance to actually come here this place is utilizing every thing they can for business.....and..it's amazing!

Why is there not a line out the door???

Why aren't the prices in the low $50??? 

I don't know but between the manager/cook-- Lamont

And the delivery guy....I won't be shocked when they head right into center city!

Fresh, great portions...and unlike some Caribbean places this food isn't salty...and been sitting there all day! I have to say of all the places in my neighborhood I support, they have my business 100%

0,"I do not recommend eating here unless you're going for the hibachi experience. Service has been poorer than poor the last two times I dined here for a simple appetizer and sushi roll. Honestly, I don't think I'll eat here again regardless. There's a new hibachi style restaurant on Anderson I hear is really good, so I think I'll take my business there instead. Whoever manages this location you're doing a crappy job because your staff sucks and that is a direct reflection of poor management and leadership.","Every now and then I'll come in here for lunch during the week. It has a very cozy location in a small shopping plaza right across the street is a huge shopping complex off Pinellas Boulevard and U.S. 19.

The parking lot is relatively small so getting there early enough to beat the lunch crowd is recommended. There's some minor seating outside and also seating indoors, but not much. 

I can describe this place is more of a takeout Vietnamese place. The quality is still the same as any other Vietnamese restaurant/cafe, but with a limited menu for food. Hence the reason it is called a café. 

If you plan on sitting down, they give you a number to place at the table and they will serve the food to you. So far from my experience there, there has only been one person back there serving the whole place and another one taking orders. 

I also learned that even though they serve the food to you, you would still have to bus your own table. There is a garbage receptacle with plastic bins where you can place your dirty dishes and utensils in after you dump your food in the trash. For me, it makes tipping confusing.

The food in my opinion is pretty good. What they specialize in our their drinks though. They have a wide assortment of milk cheese, regular teas, shaved ice drinks, and fruity or milky slushy's. I cannot really judge on too many of those drinks because all I've had so far is there a really good lavender milk tea with Boba. 

It's worth giving this place a try.","Text1: I do not recommend eating here unless you're going for the hibachi experience.

We also got an order of chips and guacamole for the table. The guacamole was good and I enjoyed my fish taco, even though it had a bit of a kick to it.

As for drinks, I went with sweet tea, which there were free refills on, but if you got soda, it looked like you just got a can, which would mean no free refills. All in all, not a bad place and I would stop in again the next time I'm in the area.","Stopped in here for lunch and walked out uncomfortable with a full belly! Was only going to get a grilled cheese sandwich, but my check-in via Yelp gave me a free soup so I went ahead and cashed in on it right there and then. Got the Smokey Corn Chowder with Bacon, and while it was quite delicious, it was heavy and I probably could have made that my meal by itself. But no, I continued on and ate all of my Baja Melt sandwich and washed it all down with a New Hope Root Beer. I really wanted one of their shakes, but I'm pretty sure I would have puked as I was utterly stuffed. I can only imagine how many calories and fat I took in during that hour, which leads me to one gripe--they don't publish their nutritional data on their web site. Personally, I get really frustrated when restaurants don't do this. There is a little kids seating area with a TV to keep them occupied. I'm surprised that they don't have a Mac-n-Cheese item on their menu.

The food was amazing. We ordered tostones con longaniza and empanadas as appetizers, beef with chimichurri and paella for the main entree. Then for dessert, we settled on a flan. They were all delicious.

We'll definitely go back to this place. Sunday supper is the perfect time since there's no wait time.","Don't be fooled by the building and the area where it's located. Just make sure your car is locked.

We were able to attend the silent Halloween movie night this past October 31st, and it was my first time there. In a 3 words: classy, elegant and simple. 

This symphony hall offers all sorts of music and performances for all different prices and people. They have drinks which you can (for certain performances) take in to the actual hall itself, in plastic cups of course. The have nice clean bathrooms, an organized coat check and very friendly staff.

I can't wait to come back to this venue!","Castrillo's is the neighborhood pizza joint of Riverside Village.  There's no indoor seating, so it's a pick up and go or get delivery kind of place, but I love ordering from there whenever I'm visiting in East Nashville.  They offer your typical pizza place toppings and pies as well as a couple more creative options.  The seafood pizza is in reality as crazy as it sounds, definatly for the adventurous.  I remember when I picked it up after ordering, the employee behind the counter greeted me with a 'so you're who ordered that pizza'.  Not really sure if that was to him a good or bad thing but he was jovial when he said it.  

As good as it is, their pizza is not what makes them stand out to me.  They're Feta Cheese sticks are so delicious, and the amount they give you is amazing, you could really order that instead of a pizza and be full.  They offer salads, sandwiches and other pizaa shop type food but its their wings that I will recommend to anyone thinking of eating here.  They are hands down the best I've had in Nashville so far.  First of all they're huge, nothing like the wimpy chicken wings you get in most places.  I can easily say they're twice the size of your average wing, and they cook them until they're so tender the meat falls into your mouth.  They only have three flavors, but they're all so tasty you could eat them every day.  The mild wings are a dry rub which is deliciously unusual and come with banana peppers sprinkled on top, the hot wings are wet and come with jalapenos and the bbq come with pineapple.  

I'm craving them again as I'm sitting here writing this and am contemplating driving over there right now in the cold to get some.","Text1: The schermerhorn is really special.

This symphony hall offers all sorts of music and performances for all different prices and people. They have drinks which you can (for certain performances) take in to the actual hall itself, in plastic cups of course. The have nice clean bathrooms, an organized coat check and very friendly staff.

I can't wait to come back to this venue! 

 Text2: Castrillo's is the neighborhood pizza joint of Riverside Village.  There's no indoor seating, so it's a pick up and go or get delivery kind of place, but I love ordering from there whenever I'm visiting in East Nashville.  They offer your typical pizza place toppings and pies as well as a couple more creative options.  The seafood pizza is in reality as crazy as it sounds, definatly for the adventurous.  I remember when I picked it up after ordering, the employee behind the counter greeted me with a 'so you're who ordered that pizza'.  Not really sure if that was to him a good or bad thing but he was jovial when he said it.  

As good as it is, their pizza is not what makes them stand out to me.  They're Feta Cheese sticks are so delicious, and the amount they give you is amazing, you could really order that instead of a pizza and be full.  They offer salads, sandwiches and other pizaa shop type food but its their wings that I will recommend to anyone thinking of eating here.  They are hands down the best I've had in Nashville so far.  First of all they're huge, nothing like the wimpy chicken wings you get in most places.  I can easily say they're twice the size of your average wing, and they cook them until they're so tender the meat falls into your mouth.  They only have three flavors, but they're all so tasty you could eat them every day.  The mild wings are a dry rub which is deliciously unusual and come with banana peppers sprinkled on top, the hot wings are wet and come with jalapenos and the bbq come with pineapple.

This place is open late on weekends, so we grabbed some cookies and coffee and settled in to talk about college and internships. It wasn't crowded--just a few folks with laptops. 

The space is pretty big, with plenty of room to work or socialize. The coffee is fine. The pastries are fine. And that's really all there is to say.","Very good food, especially the sandwiches and pizza.  Good beer selection and a friendly and prompt staff.  Enter from parking lot and there is a square shaped bar in the middle of the room with seating on three sides.  To the north of the bar is family seating with lower & hightop tables.  There's also a patio on this side that is great during warm weather.  To the south of the bar are hightop tables.  One last small room in the SW corner with lower tables for eating.  Bar stool are wooden but have a back support.  Wooden bar top with a good rail and brass footrest.  Not much of a bar back, but there is a board with daily beers.  Plenty of large HDTVs makes this a great place to watch the big game.  Just hope your game doesn't conflict with an ""important"" soccer match.  Usually busy with a casual vibe.  Never had a bad meal.","Text1: Oh Philly, I miss you and your indifferent baristas. I promised my niece that we'd go out for coffee when I was visiting, and we decided to hit the city.

0,"I love this place. When I was in college I probably went here once a week. It's really cheap to get a slice of pizza and a fountain soda. And the selections are awesome. I generally go for whichever one has pesto on it, but over the years I've tried a bunch and I don't think I've ever been disappointed. 

They've definitely been upgrading the space itself since I arrived on campus in 2003 and everything has certainly been for the better.

If you're with some people and you all want your own unique slice and perhaps a beverage with some alcohol stop in.","I find it difficult to rate a chain, but this location is one of the closest to me, although not much a coffee drinker, I do visit more than the others.  I have never had a poor beverage from this location, and recently they started serving limited gluten free treats.  I spotted a wrapped 2pk of chocolate cookies in the case yesterday. The USA menu is coming up here, just slower than molasses.

They upgraded a while back and added power outlets. Handy in a pinch!

Yes, I definitely come back. And you should get a Starbucks card and the app for the perks. So easy to pay from my phone if I forget my wallet - heck even if I have my card or wallet. Gold stars! Earn beverage upgrades, and freebies. Nothing wrong with that.","Text1: I love this place. When I was in college I probably went here once a week.

1,"Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.  The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.  

True to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.  Finally, my sushi sample of an Eel & Avocado Roll was average, with much more Avo than Eel, and artificially colored Wasabe and Ginger.  

Bottom Line - The suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here.  Everything was accommodating to the local market.  Too much broccoli, and not enough real heat. Not bad if this is what you are looking for.","As a facility to hold a large luncheon meeting for about 150 lawyers, this Wyndham Garden Hotel in the heart of Trenton, NJ, is reasonably decent. Walking distance from the courthouses, and parking deck next door, it is easily accessible for most who want to attend to get a good meal while listening to a quality presentation on the latest issues in internet discovery requirements and security. These Bench Bar lunches are always a good place to catch up with friends and hobnob with the judges in this vicinage. 

The banquet room was large enough to commodate all of us, had an adequate sound system that everyone could hear clearly, and a catering kitchen that put out a Cornish hen plate that was tasty and attractive. The carrot cake dessert was a bit over the top, but no one was complaining about the buttercream icing. 

Service was unabtrusive, but kept the meal moving and the water glasses full. 

Can't speak to the rooms above, but this operation handled our bar association meeting quite well.","Text1: Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.

1,"I love Dunkin Donuts.  We buy the whole beans and grind them every day to make our morning coffee.  The Coffee has a distinctive taste that just gets your morning going.

While I am here, I get an iced coffee too.  It is very refreshing, and is the best chain store to get coffee.  

There are better places that are not owned by a corporate company.  However for a chain this is the best place to get coffee.

The bottom line is Dunkin Donuts is great for taste and quality.","I went to another store to buy some fluorescent lights for the kitchen.  Those lights did not work.  I found the lights at Sears with no problem, they worked, and were cheaper than the original store where I went.

What more can you ask for in a hardware store?  I do believe there could be more staff working here, but that is a small complaint.","Text1: I love Dunkin Donuts.

1,"Outliers gets a generous 3 star rating from me, but is a place I will continue to go back to when it is convenient to get a few beers. I have to judge them up against the ever growing list of breweries in Indy, and it just seems that they fall towards the back of the pack in most categories.  

Let's start with the beer. They almost always have their 4 house beers on tap. These include a brown, an IPA, a rye, and a pilsner. All of them are decent beers and worth getting, but none of them are head over heels better than what you can get at most places. Along with those 4 are usually a few taps of either a seasonal or some Brugge stuff. I have had some good sour/fruit beers from here, and I know they do some different barrel aging as well, so there are some interesting options every once in a while. The issue is that these extra beers, when they have them, are really slow to change and they haven't expanded their standard lineup in the year and a half they have been brewing. It seems in my experience that it is not uncommon to see the same tap offerings for well over a month, which leads to me not stopping in here as much as I would otherwise. They just don't hold a flame to the variety of styles and beers that the other breweries in Indy have, and their lineup gets boring quickly because of it.

The space is not much to get excited about either. It's an old warehouse with some picnic tables to sit at and some plastic tables in front of a tap trailer where you order your beer, but they have gone out of their way to keep the brewing and drinking areas separate, which is very disappointing. I love visiting breweries that have their brewery area prominently featured in their location, but you can't see much of any of their operation from the tables, which makes sitting in the old space even less justifiable when there are lots and lots of breweries in Indy that have a nicer setup and their whole operation is in view of the customers. They pretty much just have about the bare-minimum setup for people to stop in a try some beers, but it looks like more of an afterthought to me and isn't a place I would choose to go sit at for an afternoon.

The hours here recently got extended to be a little better than they were, so now you can drink here Friday from 4-8, Saturday from 2-5, or Sunday from 12-4. These hours make it obvious that they have a brewery that thrives on sales to restaurants much more than sales from their location. Service hasn't always been the best, and often it seems like the people working here are more what you would find at a brew fest where they are just volunteers helping the company out by pouring some beers. They are usually a little slow, don't know much about the beer, and I have on numerous occasions gotten served short pours because there is so much foam in my beer that they don't dump out or let settle. They are always nice though, and I assume it is hard to find someone who is a great customer service person who wants to work only a few hours on a Saturday afternoon or Friday evening.

I like that they are another local breweries that makes some good stuff, and their location close to my place is a big draw for me. It will continue to be a brewery that I stop at to get some decent beers at good prices, and maybe to try the occasional new offering, but it seems like they have been at a standstill for a while as far as what they have to offer so my visits keep getting more and more spread out. Hopefully things are working out for them though, and I will continue to keep an eye on their social media to seek out their new stuff when they have it.","I've stopped by here a couple of times since their fairly recent opening, both for dinner and just to get a couple drinks, and I am impressed with this new place. It is a nice addition to the area, and provides a dining experience that feels a little different than anything else around here right now.

First of all, they did a great job with the space. There wasn't much of the historic building left to start with, so it doesn't necessarily have a feel of an old historic place, even though the history is interesting, but it is an attractive space and has an upscale feel without being stuffy. It's much larger than I expected it to be based on the original building. The hostess stand is downstairs with room around it to stand while waiting for a table (it's recommended to make a reservation at this point, as there was an hour wait when we went on Friday evening). They have a large downstairs bar, along with a couple different seating areas. The separation of the space into smaller sections makes it feel a little more intimate and probably helps keep the noise down. Upstairs is a slightly smaller bar with more tables and a couple booths to sit at. I am really looking forward to the summer when they open up the large rooftop section that you can only look at through the large glass windows now. 

The main thing that stood out to me on both visits is the professionalism of the staff. I assume it helps that the owners of the restaurant have so many other businesses already, but they were ready to go from day 1 and everyone we interacted with, from the hostess to the bartenders to the servers, have been top notch.  It is certainly a more upscale dining experience from the standpoint of the space and the service.

The bar touts the largest selection of tequila I have seen in quite some time. Tequila is the liquor I am the least familiar with so I can't really comment about the bottles they have, but you certainly have a lot of options to choose from. They also have a nice whiskey selection that is reasonably priced for the setting. Their list of 8 or so house cocktails sounded amazing when their bartender expertly described each one to us, and they had numerous ingredients in them that were my first encounters with. The beer list is only okay. They have a dozen things on tap that include some local standards and some national domestic craft things. There are more options in bottles and cans, but it nothing too impressive. 

The food, while good, didn't blow me away like other people seem to indicate. I felt like it was all good, but relative to the price point, it wasn't fantastic. The menu is fairly small, but it does have a decent amount of variety. What it does offer is a unique selection of items that aren't things you are going to find at many other restaurants. Their menu is broken down into sections; primero, segundo, empanadas, ensaladas, and dulce. As you can probably grasp from that, it is a Latin themed place. The dishes are tapas style so they are fairly small. Our server recommended us to get a couple of items off of the primero and a couple off of the segundo section for a full meal for 2 people. We ended up with brussels sprouts, patatas bravas, chorizo empanadas, and the pork pastor. Everything was tasty, but it wasn't anything that really felt exceptional. We finished everything, and while it was a filling meal, we weren't close to needed a to-go box. I think our bill for the food, after tax, was a little over $35 for the relatively lower priced options that we ended up with. That's a decently priced meal for things that I thought weren't significantly impressive, but it also wasn't too much to feel the visit was at all regrettable. There were certainly plenty of things on the menu that we wanted to get and had to pass on during this visit, so I am sure I will be back again to try more. I foresee this being a great place to stop in and get one of their delicious sounding deserts late on a winter evening.

This is conveniently within walking distance of me, so I didn't have to worry about parking. It is located on the cultural trail, so it isn't hard to get to if you parked somewhere on Mass Ave. They do have valet parking that is available in front of the building on College Ave. There are also some parking options along College Ave if you can find an open spot. I don't recall if they actually have a small lot or not.

I will definitely be back to try more of their menu and to start making my way through their list of house cocktails. I definitely recommend this as a place to visit that provides a nicer atmosphere for dinner than a lot of the other options in the Mass Ave area. It would make a great date spot, as it has a great ambiance, fantastic service, and is quiet enough to easily hold a conversation with the person across from you. I'm looking forward to my next visit.","Text1: Outliers gets a generous 3 star rating from me, but is a place I will continue to go back to when it is convenient to get a few beers.

1,Momos has great service and good food with decent prices. There's also belly dancing most nights during the week! The menu has lots of variety so there are lots of options to choose from. The lamb kebobs are good. The shrimp and grits is also very good. The chocolate phyllo dessert is ok but a little too crunchy for my taste.  The chocolate creme brule' is very rich and delicious.,"This review is only for the tall hurricane I had at Willie's, and not for the food, as I haven't had their food. On every block on Bourbon St, you can find a damn Willie's Chicken Shack. It did not help my sense of direction down there at all. Rather than go back and forth looking for a good place to grab a hurricane, my cousin and I opted to get one at Willie's. Here are my thoughts...

I liked the $15 price tag for a huge, collectible tall cup (you know the one that's synonymous with Bourbon St at this point) of hurricane. And I like that there was a good variety of different daiquiri flavors to choose from and/or mix. But, when it comes to the strength of my drink, I would suggest opting for another location or adding (several) shots of alcohol to kick it up a notch.

The flavor of my traditional hurricane slushy was good, but I felt like it was barely any stronger than what you find at a 7/11 slushy machine. I'm not going to lie though, I drunk it down fast, and it, mixed with the other liquor in my system from dinner that evening, did give me a buzz. I'm just saying I have reason to believe that another hurricane/daiquiri purveyor on Bourbon may have given me something a bit more potent. IJS.","Text1: Momos has great service and good food with decent prices. There's also belly dancing most nights during the week!

1,"Happened upon this little shop en route to another destination.   Because fishmongers are hard to come by in Bucks County, I felt obliged to stop and check it out.   The first thing you notice is the utter absence of a fishy aroma.   Exactly the way it should be.   The counter help was very helpful.   I was looking for stone crab claws, and the counter help suggested Jonah crab claws instead because they were available and less expensive.

Because fishmongers are hard to come by in Bucks County, I felt obliged to stop and check it out.   The first thing you notice is the utter absence of a fishy aroma.   Exactly the way it should be.   The counter help was very helpful.   I was looking for stone crab claws, and the counter help suggested Jonah crab claws instead because they were available and less expensive.

0,"I had a lot of expectations going into Milktooth based on the reviews I had been reading. I was excited because the concept of a restaurant with an upscale coffee bar was reminiscent of a restaurant (Cafe Medina) that I like to go to in my hometown of Vancouver. I also really liked that they serve several different beans from different roasters.

After eating at Milktooth, I must say that the food was just okay, and the iced coffee that I had was meh, while the regular drip was okay. I don't know if it was quite worth the 45 minute wait. I think my experience was dampened by the flies that kept flying into me, on my food, and drinking from my water glass. At one point, the waitress had come by to ask if everything was okay while a was holding my fork with a fly standing right on it.

I started with an iced vietnamese coffee. I was disappointed by it because it was very weak and watery. The floral flavor of the beans was there, it was the right type of beans and roast, but it was just too weak. I knew this was going to happen because when I was observing the coffee being made, the beans were not packed down enough to allow for the water to steep long enough and have a slower drip. Instead, the water was dripping down too fast into the glass, much like a typical pour over. This process resulted in a coffee whose color was more of an orange than an almost black brown, so when it was actually mixed with the condensed milk, it was almost a vanilla/peach color instead of medium coffee color. This may have been intentional on their part, to get drinks and orders through as quick as possible, but it was probably the worst iced vietnamese coffee I've ever had. It made it the worst because I was expecting my thick, full-bodied, acidic coffee with the richness of the condensed milk and the cooling effect of the ice.

For the food, we had the strawberry shortcake donut holes with whipped goat cheese. This was my favorite, it was definitely good. It made me more open to the idea of ordering more food after my main meal just because I wanted to try more stuff.  However, after I had my okonomiyaki (a favorite treat that I love to eat), and my partner had her Huevos, we did not want to order any more food. Not because we were full, but because we were underwhelmed and feeling like the food we got was overpriced for the quality.  My okonomiyaki was bland. It was missing something. The combination of egg, broken ramen noodles, and calamari really made it bland. I was expecting the bacon to add some flavor, and of course the okonomiyaki sauce and the japanese mayo, but because of the way the bacon was cooked, the full flavor of the bacon did not come through and added to the bland, somewhat fatty taste of the okonomiyaki. Perhaps the okonomiyaki would have benefitted from stronger green onions and some bonito.  As for the Huevos, I can't say much, except my partner commented that it would not have tasted like anything without the salmon, but something about the salmon was actually putting her off it. My partner really liked her mimosa though and said it's the best she's had in a while.

So overall? My experience was okay, a bit underwhelming and based on the food that I received, I thought it was a bit overpriced. Will I come back? I will probably come back for the drinks, and maybe try the tea wings and other pastries.","On a hot day, this is the place to be in Downtown Nashville!

Nickel & Dimin' your way to the top, huh. However, I have no idea how printing long codes is cheaper than printing names. 

This is more of a review of the Megabus drop-off / pick-up location than the bus experience itself. Coldest day of the year. Snow. Wind. To boot, a bungled, botched box of a Santa suit in my hands. Uh huh. And, on this trip, I opted for the antique suitcase that is by hand carrying only; so, for a man who thinks being hands free is key to his control-freak stay-safe & comfortable ways, this is not a situation conducive to walking a block or two to the nearest bar while I wait for my ride. I'll drop the box, the santa suit will come tumbling out, it'll fall in the slush, a horse & carriage will purge innards onto it and then Megabus will speed off from the stoplight splashing grease-splayed splats all over the santa suit -- and my luggage, and me. I won't have any of that flailing. I'd rather stand here in misery. But why do I have to be miserable? Why is there not a bar here? Hot Dog cart anyone? Beer shack?  Sure, there's the legal beagle but they're rarely open it seems. And why one bar? Why more bail bonding than ale bonding, huh? 

I've only been dropped off here once... but I drive by this location all the time, and there my fellow Plebeians are... stranded, standing there in a desolate downtown urban space -- straight outta 12 Monkeys. 

Megabus has arrived. Thoroughly, people use this stop every day between Chicago & 'Nati travelers. It's time either Megabus invests in some kind of hipster-style bus stop where they have a ""megabus"" banana stand or a taco truck. I don't care. Just something. I'm paying the same amount as Greyhound now. And, they hook us up with stale donuts and coffee surrounded by 3am Mennonite huddles. Who's the hipster travel bus now?

And having been spoiled enough to work with, and dine with, dear Japanese friends, I can be picky.  But let's just call this place what it is: a good place for some decent sushi, located close to the 440 interchange where you can grab a meal on the way home.  They do takeout, FYI, which is very nice when you're in a rush.

There are some fun rolls on the menu, like their baked samarai roll (with red snapper) and their famous Shreveport orgasm roll (tempura shrimp, spicy tuna).  They do great bento boxes (my favorite would be the bulgogi).  The nigiri (traditional Japanese-style sushi with a piece of fish on top of rice) isn't my favorite in all honestly.  The have a great house salad with a delicious dressing and I love their simple yet soothing miso soup.

The service here is always warm and welcoming and like I said, you can't go wrong with takeout.  It's so nice to grab food on the way home after a long day.

0,"I have been coming to Allisonville Nursery for many years now and continue to be impressed.  I have never purchased trees here but have purchased a wide variety of shrubs (boxwoods, hostas, ninebark, several viburnum varieties, etc.) and all are going very strong in my yard.

I've always been impressed with the quality of the plants here...although my father used to own a landscape business (and purchase wholesale) and I have a pretty good feel for prices.  I think some of it is a tad expensive.  Not too concerned though...I don't mind supporting local business and the store is just really cool.  None of the green peppers I purchased from here last year bore any fruit (similar plant from Home Depot same spot did fine), so that has been my only issue.

As others mentioned, there are a large selection of garden accents, pots, fertilizers, etc.  It really is a very comprehensive selection of products...and there are many items you won't find at a big box.

The staff is extremely helpful...today I was looking for a pedestal for a sundial and the staff went out of their way to assist me in what I was looking for.  I ended up leaving with a birdbath and Patty (?) spent a good amount of time helping...thank you!  It just is the sort of place for people who love gardening and the outdoors...impulse buying is very easy here.

Note of caution...in the spring on a weekend this place can get extremely crowded.  Getting assistance is definitely more an issue just due to volume. If you need help swing by during the week...they will take care of you.","What a gem, if there ever was one. I love walking the perimeter and looking at the lovely houses. By the way, if I ever win the lottery, that's where I'm moving. CITY!

0,"The thing about City Park is there are a lot of cool little things that are in the park that you might not even realize are there. Couturie Forest is one of those spots.

A photographer friend of mine actually introduced me to this place and while the term ""forest"" is probably a bit generous, I would say that it's more of a nature based hiking trail. If you have ever been to the hiking trails at Jean Lafitte, I would say that it's along those lines.

There are nice little trails throughout the forest with different plants and greenery all around. I really enjoyed walking through the shady parts, since it was rather hot on the day I visited I think the trail is open late-until 7 or 8, so it would be a good spot to check out on a late afternoon when the sun is starting to set.","Tucked away in a forgotten strip center somewhere in the hamlet of Southampton sits THE BEST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO!!!!!

When I see that hot pink truck, I start jumping like a little kid and I get so excited!! I will wait in the longest line for this Mac, I don't care! It's that good. 

The BBQ chicken Mac is my favorite so far, but they always change the flavors so you can always try something new! I love that! I recently had the spinach & artichoke Mac, that was killer also. All the special combo macs are better than their 7 cheese original, IMO.  so try something fancy!  The Mac is so creamy and rich, that's what I love. You hardly taste the noodles cause the cheese and other toppings are so rich.. That's how you make Mac!! It should be so creamy that it sticks to the roof of your mouth.. Yes! Mac mart does it right!! 

I got 2 of my friends hooked on it already, who's never had it before. They love it too! And the staff working the truck are so friendly they rock.

0,"Mumbai knows what it's doing. It's going for wide appeal and succeeding. With vegan-friendly, buffet-style curry at $4.95/lb, you aren't going to hear any complaints from this guy. They avoid the potential pitfall of inadequate heating on the buffet line, and for an additional buck, you can add a side of naan. 

I have frequently pointed people in Mumbai's direction not only because of the food quality, but also because of the unbeatable prices. Not to be the eternal pessimist, but this is not the best Indian food in Philly. It's the best price, without question, and the service is always friendly; however, there are some other options worth considering if you want top-notch Tikka Masala and other Westernized curry dishes. 

Mumbai Bistro is definitely deserving of a 4-star review and while there may be nicer Indian restaurants in the city, few could compete with its accessibility. For those working in Center City, this is a staple.","Very good food, especially the sandwiches and pizza.  Good beer selection and a friendly and prompt staff.  Enter from parking lot and there is a square shaped bar in the middle of the room with seating on three sides.  To the north of the bar is family seating with lower & hightop tables.  There's also a patio on this side that is great during warm weather.  To the south of the bar are hightop tables.  One last small room in the SW corner with lower tables for eating.  Bar stool are wooden but have a back support.  Wooden bar top with a good rail and brass footrest.  Not much of a bar back, but there is a board with daily beers.  Plenty of large HDTVs makes this a great place to watch the big game.  Just hope your game doesn't conflict with an ""important"" soccer match.  Usually busy with a casual vibe.  Never had a bad meal.","Text1: Mumbai knows what it's doing. It's going for wide appeal and succeeding. With vegan-friendly, buffet-style curry at $4.95/lb, you aren't going to hear any complaints from this guy. They avoid the potential pitfall of inadequate heating on the buffet line, and for an additional buck, you can add a side of naan. 

I have frequently pointed people in Mumbai's direction not only because of the food quality, but also because of the unbeatable prices. Not to be the eternal pessimist, but this is not the best Indian food in Philly. It's the best price, without question, and the service is always friendly; however, there are some other options worth considering if you want top-notch Tikka Masala and other Westernized curry dishes. 

Mumbai Bistro is definitely deserving of a 4-star review and while there may be nicer Indian restaurants in the city, few could compete with its accessibility. For those working in Center City, this is a staple. 

 Text2: Very good food, especially the sandwiches and pizza.  Good beer selection and a friendly and prompt staff.  Enter from parking lot and there is a square shaped bar in the middle of the room with seating on three sides.  To the north of the bar is family seating with lower & hightop tables.  There's also a patio on this side that is great during warm weather.  To the south of the bar are hightop tables.  One last small room in the SW corner with lower tables for eating.

1,"This was my first visit to this particular location of Famoso. And while it was quite a wait for a table, the food was delicious and another restaurant patron gave us a coupon for $10 off our meal (it expired that day) which made our dinner more affordable than expected! 

Our table service was good and the food was really quite great especially as their January special was still going on at the time that we visited (a whole bunch of customer appreciation specials at $8/each). A good affordable meal with good atmosphere and service. Where could we go wrong?","While I've only been here once, my experience was a pleasure. Not only was the food prompt and delicious but I adored the bread with oil and vinegar and the servers checked with our table regularly to ensure that we were not in need of anything. 

This restaurant is tiny, but the food is delicious which totally makes the ambient noise level all right. I liked the table cloth, the lighting, the extensive menu with many options and the aesthetics of this tiny place. The parking lot is also small but that's fine too. There is easy transit to this location via a number of bus routes as well which is neat!","Text1: This was my first visit to this particular location of Famoso.

1,"For all the dining out we do, we never made it here before. It's adorable inside- the decor feels like an old brasserie. We started with bruschetta, which was good- but would have been better on slightly thicker pieces of bread, rather than thin crostini. I ordered the carbonara, which was tasty, but a tad salty, likely due to the generous amount of pancetta in it. Hubs had filet, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned and came with a loaded baked potato. Beer and cocktail list was good and our server was sweet, too.","Solid meal here tonight. Our server was funny and friendly. We started with samosa chat and gobi manchurian- haven't had either before and we inhaled it. Then we got our usual, for the sake of comparing these to other places I've eaten. My malai kofta were a bit pastier than I like, but had good flavor. Hubs seemed to like his tikka masala. The rice is fluffy and flavorful and the onion kulcha was tasty. Felt like we got a lot of food and we left stuffed....and only $48 lighter in the wallet.","Text1: For all the dining out we do, we never made it here before.

1,"I came in late at night so there was no wait. I went with the Duck and Pineapple curry. This came out pretty quickly and was delicious. There was a bit of a spicy burn that warmed me right up, but not too much that I couldn't handle it. The duck meat was a little on the dry side, but still pretty tender with no bones in it. The curry was flavored perfectly and I wish I had more rice to soak it in and then more curry to soak that additional rice in. It was sweet and spicy and delicious.","The 3 rolls for $10.25 is a great deal. I got it for take out, the staff was friendly and quickly prepared the rolls. It was a lot of food for the price, and I'm glad that the deal is all day rather than just the lunch crowd. I ordered the lobster roll (similar to spicy salmon without the spicy), spicy tuna, and an alaskian roll (salman, cucumber, avocado). All were good, especially the price. I would definitely and probably will go back soon.","Text1: I came in late at night so there was no wait. I went with the Duck and Pineapple curry. This came out pretty quickly and was delicious.

Also, sign up for their weekly email and they will send you a coupon every Sunday. But don't try to use it on a Sunday because they are closed on Sundays, which is why they are losing a star.

VERY disappointed to learn they no longer have happy hour all the time. Yes, we were going to drink with our brunch. Don't judge! :) I got the Ultimate Omelette and it was still pretty yummy. Our bartender was ok, but didn't go out of his way to be friendly and never once smiled.

I understand not seating until everyone arrives, but it seems extreme that you can't get a place in line while waiting.

The Service once we got inside was good. The server was diligent. Though if you like things hot, ask for the hot sauce when you order. They serve salsa instead of bottles so it takes a little while. The fish tacos, mojitos, and tres leches cake were delicious though.

I still will always have a place in my heart for West Philly's Fuh Wah tofu banh mi, but Nhu Y is now closer - and will fill the gap just fine.

Am I totally missing the Sarcone's rolls, though?  I've never seen 'em here before!","I have heard great reviews from my friends.  I finally tried it.  

First impression:  Signage was bland on the side of the restaurant but attractive on the front.  Inside was nicely decorated and clean.

As for the food, I ordered a $10 duck glass noodle soup (I questioned where are the mushrooms).  The duck was not roasted but alright.  It was a huge bowl of soup.  Unfortunately, I was expected to be overstuffed instead of understuffed.  I needed more food.  My friend said that she would share an egg roll appetizer; there were 3 small, crispy vegetable rolls (I would say spring rolls) and fish oil for dipping at the cost of $3.95.  They were good but seemed overpriced.

I was still hungry.  No fortune cookie to end my meal -- maybe that is just at Chinese restaurants.","Text1: Nhu Y - purveyor of delicious banh mi.

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is just fine if you want mediocre brothy soup embellished with garlic or spice, decorated with half a hard boiled egg.  Is this really the trend?

1,"I haven't been here in a while, since they were dog friendly, they are not anymore. It annoys me a bit because most of the restaurants in Dunedin are. 

They have a nice size outside covered shaded patio. Come on Kelly's bring it back. Most pet owners are 200% responsible. (I really hate how the irresponsible pet owners kill it for the rest of us.)

This time around we came for my pre-birthday celebration. I was excited that they accepted reservations, and having a bigger group was done with ease. Make sure u do ask if the fan works. We got the section that did not. 

Since we were in the group section, it was super loud. It was everyone's birthday so it was super fitting.

Our waitress was pretty good considering how busy it was.  

For food, it was difficult for me to choose. I wanted a fish entree they had on special, it was gone. Many of what they had for options had tons of carbs, which I really wanted to lay off on. My hubby and a handful of the group had the espresso rubbed steak and loved it. Of course, my hubby always says get something diff. 

I'm not listening to him next time. I chose the beef tenderloin app and ahi tuna. I liked the ahi tuna better.

My birthday cake was a nice cherry on top that I split with the rest of the group.

I didn't get a drink this time around. I did try my friend's drink which was hella strong.

All in all, I'm blessed to have great friends that make my night perfect as can be.","My hubby and I are so in sync & we were thinking the same thing without even saying it. We love love love Wiregrass Mall, & have so many memories at this simple place.

 We moved here a handful of years ago. We would walk around, hang outside. Bring our laptops, browse around the shops, eat at Grillsmith. 

Mocha, our doggie won a most cutest dog contest at the Halloween contest for two years(Thanks for the $50 gift cards we would win!)

 We would always without a doubt come for Christmas lighting show. They have the most wonderful XMAS Tree, fireworks, and fake snow.

We come here a few times a week, and Mocha, our shihtzu plays in the center stage area with his ball.  

We also come many of the Fresh Markets here on the 1st and 3rd weekend of the month.

My fave stores here are Charming Charlies, Bath & Body Works, Pottery Barn, Bare Minerals, and Macys.

I also love Grillsmith and Primebar, and they also have Cantina Laredo (go for happy hour), 100 Montaditos, Pinchers, and Brass Tap.

 Text2: My hubby and I are so in sync & we were thinking the same thing without even saying it. We love love love Wiregrass Mall, & have so many memories at this simple place.

 We moved here a handful of years ago. We would walk around, hang outside. Bring our laptops, browse around the shops, eat at Grillsmith. 

Mocha, our doggie won a most cutest dog contest at the Halloween contest for two years(Thanks for the $50 gift cards we would win!)

 We would always without a doubt come for Christmas lighting show. They have the most wonderful XMAS Tree, fireworks, and fake snow.

We come here a few times a week, and Mocha, our shihtzu plays in the center stage area with his ball.  

We also come many of the Fresh Markets here on the 1st and 3rd weekend of the month.

My fave stores here are Charming Charlies, Bath & Body Works, Pottery Barn, Bare Minerals, and Macys.

I also love Grillsmith and Primebar, and they also have Cantina Laredo (go for happy hour), 100 Montaditos, Pinchers, and Brass Tap.

Love it here, love how super dog friendly it is here. Love it all. Soon we will have the new outlet mall, but this will always be our place!!!",yes
0,I am a lover of craft beer and I came to Perennial for the first time during a Yoga Buzz event actually where we had a private yoga class in their tasting room then were treated to a beer tasting afterwards. They have a small tasting room with several tables and lots of board games that would make for a great weekend afternoon with friends. They also have a lot of bar space to sit and have a beer and geek out with the bartenders. Before our tasting we were educated in the different varietals they had on tap including their ingredients and tasting notes. I tried both of their saisons they had on tap which were pretty flavorful but not my favorite. I loved their darkness chocolate orange stout which was right on line with some of my favorite stouts. Their beer is more pricey than the other local breweries in town but they also brew it in smaller batches. Will definitely be back!,"This is a heart attack in a box, which usually means great tasting food. It does here. Fried chicken, Shrimp. Gizzards, Chicken Livers, Fish ""and steak fingers too,"" as the  commercial jingle goes. ( A jingle you'll never get out of your head once  when you hear it.)  All succulent and flavorful. We love the fries, slaw and garlic toast too.  EVERTHING is a joy to eat, even if you have to pay later. The original family recipes from 1953 are still l  followed. This location is their first location in  Tucson. #1, but there are now 8 locations in Tucson. This place is #1 indeed.","Text1: I am a lover of craft beer and I came to Perennial for the first time during a Yoga Buzz event actually where we had a private yoga class in their tasting room then were treated to a beer tasting afterwards.

1,I went to Smiley's for falafel and they were out of falafel. At noon. On a weekday.,"Decidedly underwhelming, but still good.

Here are the facts:

1. Communal seating only.
2. Two kinds of wine: ""house"" red and white. Outrageously priced at $8.50/glass.
3. If you're not into meat on your pizza, you don't have that many veggie options. It's Margherita, or eggplant, or lots of cheese. There ain't nothin' green round these parts.
4. If you like meat on your pie, there's no pepperoni, or soppresata. Sausage or prosciutto only. 

Flavors are standard. Quality cheese, sauce and crust. Service is fine. I wouldn't rush back...from Vetri, I expected better.","Text1: I went to Smiley's for falafel and they were out of falafel. At noon. On a weekday.

0,"I love Dunkin Donuts.  We buy the whole beans and grind them every day to make our morning coffee.  The Coffee has a distinctive taste that just gets your morning going.

While I am here, I get an iced coffee too.  It is very refreshing, and is the best chain store to get coffee.  

There are better places that are not owned by a corporate company.  However for a chain this is the best place to get coffee.

The bottom line is Dunkin Donuts is great for taste and quality.","Do you long for poor quality drinks served in plastic cups all the while the smell of vomit and urine assault you?

1,"It isn't easy to find Korean in CC, and the options are so few that we haven't had any bibimbap in....wow, can't even remember! So when I noticed BAP's signage while walking home after grocery shopping, I made a mental note to try them asap since their opening special of $5 bibimbap is awesome!

You can't beat a cheap meal, and especially one that's prepared with obviously fresh vegetables! My husband picked up our dinner right before I got off from work, but it's so cold outside we had to reheat them - thankfully the microwave didn't ruin anything. He got the beef and I opted just for the vegetables, both of which came with an egg. The variety of veggies is great, but most importantly they are clearly fresh, not frozen or canned, and it makes a huge difference with bibimbap. The sauces were good, but I felt like the veggie one lacked a little bit on flavors. Spicy level was minimal when you mixed everything together, so I ended up adding more for myself. We will certainly be back for more yummy, healthy, and quick takeout from this super cute spot!","I love Capogiro, and think really highly of their gelato (god knows I ate enough throughout all of Italy to trust my sense of quality). They certainly know how to choose locations that will rake in the $$$, especially with this one right in the heart of UCity, and on the main drag leading from UPenn/Drexel campuses towards the movie theater and all of the restaurants and bars. 

The main crowds consist of students (which of course can range from the nice to the obnoxious, depending on day/time during the week) and also all of the residents of UCity and those that come to the movie theater. But regardless of the guaranteed crowded location, while schools are in session and especially once the weather gets warmer, you are at least also guaranteed the same high quality, scrumptious gelato melting on your tongue.","Text1: It isn't easy to find Korean in CC, and the options are so few that we haven't had any bibimbap in....wow, can't even remember!

1,"I've been here for a few times, and I'm in love with this place. The menu is quite impressive, and it will seriously take more than a few minutes to read through the choices.  (The huge star in the middle of the menu can be quite distracting!). If you need a good sushi lunch place, then get the lunch special. They have an awesome deal at 3 rolls for $12, which includes either soup or salad. Guess how many choices of rolls you get to choose from? 43!!! Lots of choices to choose from, and I really digged the Pepper Tuna roll and the Alaskan roll. I had the crabmeat apple roll, but didn't care much for it.

More reasons to love this place: Service is fast and friendly, and they have LOW-sodium soy sauce. 

My challenge is to try different rolls/dishes each time I go there, except the California roll. :)","Amazing! Fantastic BYO.

Came here on a cold, winter night for the first time. So many people have raved about this place, and now I know why. From the moment we sat down, we felt we were like the only ones there. (We clearly were not. The place was absolutely lively with so much happiness around!). The owner introduced himself to us, and helped us decide on what to order. We ordered the  lamb stew, monkfish, this phyllo pie appetizer (forgot the name), and later, a very tasty chocolate and date dessert.

Perhaps it was the flowing wine at every table, but the restaurant was crowded with large parties, family get togethers, and a birthday party. We were in good company. Narrow spaces for the servers to bring us food and water, but they were great in maneuvering around this small restaurant.

I cannot wait to come here again to try their brunch. The experience was a solid one. Large, delicious dishes that were made love. Super friendly owner and servers. Inviting and vibrant atmosphere. Great choice for a date night (first, second,146th), girls night (reunions, catch-up on gossip, talk about boys, share baby pictures), guys night (place for excellent food, talk about girls), birthday parties (BYO, 'nuff said), and any other occasion.

Seriously, a great restaurant to dine and share the experience with your loved ones.","Text1: I've been here for a few times, and I'm in love with this place.

0,tried them out for the first time at the night market last night...wanted to do the takoyaki but the line was wayyyy tooo long for that..so I ordered the curry burrito...wow not good at all...will give them another shot in the future.,"While the brunch is not as good as Cafe Lift, in my opinion, I am a fan of Honey's.

I like the location a lot and the decor is very quirky. 

Service here is good. We got our food pretty fast on a busy day and when no one is there, it's usually less than 15 minutes.

My negatives are that the prices are a little too high. Extra for fries? Not cool, but at least the fries are great.

Cash only makes it difficult sometimes and while I probably will not dine here for quite some time, remember to get cash ahead of time so you don't have to bite the bullet with ATM fees.

Overall, I love their comfort food but specifically the Shrimp Po'Boy, the fries, and the Jewish Apple Cake (which I have had better but I am still  a sucker for).

Definitely give Honey's a shot, I think most people will like it.","Text1: tried them out for the first time at the night market last night...wanted to do the takoyaki but the line was wayyyy tooo long for that..so I ordered the curry burrito...wow not good at all...will give them another shot in the future.

1,"I really like this place! Not only do they serve sandwiches and things like that, but they have a full sushi bar, too.

When you are in this restaurant you really feel like you are in another world. I guess part of that is because it's in a hotel. This place is super ""trendy"" with fancy big screens and a ""modern"" kind of layout.

For my meal I decided that I wanted a Philly roll for my appetizer and a pressed burger for my meal. Weird, huh? Well, unfortunately the roll and the burger ended up coming out together, so I basically had a hamburger with sushi on the side. No biggie. The burger was okay, but not overly great. The sushi roll was super fresh and tasty.

If I go back, I'm sticking with the sushi.","Oh, Billy Bob's, I really wanted you to be more than three stars.

When I went here for lunch today, I was pretty excited.  I had been looking forward to checking this place out since it had opened a few months ago.  I like BBQ and sandwiches (although I'm no BBQ aficionado) and I went in with an open mind.

As soon as I walked in, my friend and I were greeted by the manager and were immediately seated.  We then met our server who was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.

For an app we ordered the fried pickles which came with ranch dressing and another dipping sauce.  They were really good and got me excited for the meal.

I ordered the hamburger, only because I wasn't in the mood for a huge meal and my friend ordered the brisket.  I got an order of mac and cheese as my side.  When my burger came, it was dressed pretty basically with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  The burgers aren't cooked to order, and the one I had was pretty dry and over cooked.  It wasn't juicy at all and I didn't even finish it.  The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't overly spectacular.  My friend ordered potato salad with the brisket, which I tried, and could tell that it was likely store bought (which isn't horrible, but I've had better).

All in all, the place was a solid three stars.  The staff was amazing, the atmosphere is nice and the food came quickly.  I was sad to see that there weren't more people in here.  I really am rooting for this place, especially because I think the Westbank needs an ""authentic"" BBQ place.","Text1: I really like this place!

Being my first visit I went with the classic breakfast...eggs, bacon toast, potatoes, coffee and orange juice. It was classic on steroids! The potatoes just a little different, the juice Is freshly squeezed, the bacon just a little thicker than usual, the strawberry jam more flavorful than most...Is it OK to eat breakfast twice because I want more now.

The food is very good, the spice levels (1-5) are consistent, and the price is right. I just had a dinner for two with drinks for 25 bucks. The serving sizes are very generous too.

1,Ice cream sandwiches are delicious!! The employees are also super friendly. Great little spot!,"Despite always trying delicious samples from this place, I have never actually made a purchase. My fiance loves their food and suggested we give it a try. Everything we sampled was tasty, but we decided on a shrimp po-boy. I'm sad to say that despite the delicious samples, the sandwich was downright terrible. While the shrimp themselves were tasty, there weren't enough of them so I was left with a big hunk of terrible bread, lettuce, pickles, and some bad tomatoes. We asked for the cajun mayo on the side, but they instead just omitted it completely. The roll was some of the worst bread I've had, particularly because Philly has such good bread options! I would definitely go back there, but never get a po-boy again. Next time I will opt for the jambalaya, gator gumbo, or blackened chicken alfredo. 5 stars based on the samples, 1.5 based on the po-boy.

1,"The Howlin Wolf is a cool venue to see a show. Plus there is a separate bar called The Den for food and drinks.

I had been to this venue before it was the Howling Wolf (Praline connection maybe?). Like many things in New Orleans, time has not changed it much, if at all.

The venue is a large open room with a bar along the back wall. The stage is large and has two New Orleans type porches on the side. While they don't do much for a concert, they would probably add ambiance to a private event.

The staff were friendly and regardless of where we were, we had a good view of the stage. The bathrooms were pretty nasty, but they were acceptable.

The Den is a great place to get drinks or food prior to a show. While I didn't have food, I've been told it is very good. Drink prices were reasonable and their beer selection was better than other venues I've been to.

I like this venue and look forward to attending more events here.","The Huey P. I have such memories of this bridge. My sadistic drivers ed teacher made me drive over you when I was a mere lad of 15. I was terrified, but I did gain valuable experience.

As I grew older, I gained more respect for this bridge. It has the old style guardrail that allows you to see how high you really are. It is one of the major rail crossings over the Mississippi River. When you're stuck in traffic and a train is crossing the rhythmic shaking of the bridge can lull you to sleep. 

Now the state is widening the bridge which will cause it to lose some of its character, but actually make it safer. What will they do next, add shoulders on the Causeway?

Now the state is widening the bridge which will cause it to lose some of its character, but actually make it safer. What will they do next, add shoulders on the Causeway?

0,"Very good food, especially the sandwiches and pizza.  Good beer selection and a friendly and prompt staff.  Enter from parking lot and there is a square shaped bar in the middle of the room with seating on three sides.  To the north of the bar is family seating with lower & hightop tables.  There's also a patio on this side that is great during warm weather.  To the south of the bar are hightop tables.  One last small room in the SW corner with lower tables for eating.  Bar stool are wooden but have a back support.  Wooden bar top with a good rail and brass footrest.  Not much of a bar back, but there is a board with daily beers.  Plenty of large HDTVs makes this a great place to watch the big game.  Just hope your game doesn't conflict with an ""important"" soccer match.  Usually busy with a casual vibe.

Our waitress was awesome, very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance, not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them, except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar, and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it, no problem.

This is definitely a dessert bar- the portions were huge. I seriously thought they brought me two. I ordered a blondie, and received a large brownie AND a nice portion of ice cream- I was in heaven; just as delicious as it looked. 

Great service, great food, great dessert. All I need. 

On another note, I love that they had several areas, a bar, an area with tables by the window, and two sections with more personal seating, sofas and comfy chairs in the back.

More importantly, Amber loves her,  and I trust her 100%.","Great spot. Spicy here is spicy... be careful... but definitely enjoyed the spicy fish. We also did the fried wontons, good but nothing crazy special, and a rice noodle dish with pork. All was delicious. There were six in our party and the bill was 42 bucks. We brought a couple bottles of wine and after tip had a great authentic dinner for under 10 bucks each.

Most importantly the service was great.  Accomodating the two vegetarians in our group was only possible with the waiters help. They also were able to seat us, as they asked another party of three to move to a smaller table so two tables could be put together.

1,"This was nothing special and seemed a little overpriced for quantity. 

It's a typical diner/cafe.  All American (and the decor will not let you forget that).

The food was not memorable and I think there are better breakfast places on the east side.  But if you are in the area and don't want to look elsewhere, swing on here.","I love this park!

It is a great place to bring out of town visitors.  The eight mile loop is an amazing drive (or bike ride, or run depending on how brave you are).  In addition, there are a ton of trails.  You can get out and see everything.  

Do stop at the visitors center if you get a chance.  They are very helpful and there is a ton of information in their which always great for those new to the desert.  They have all the trail maps and you can buy a pass if you are so inclined.

Take plenty of water, and some snacks or a lunch and enjoy everything the landscape has to offer.

Be very careful of cyclists/runners when driving.  You shouldn't be in a hurry anyway as you should be enjoying the scenery.

I highly recommend this place to everyone!","Text1: This was nothing special and seemed a little overpriced for quantity.

0,"Not sure if they were on their best behavior because of the influx of Fantasies in Chocolate people coming out for the afterparty, or if they have just righted the ship that was off course or what.  But my experience at Lex Nightclub was just fine.

We didn't have bottle service or anything special.  We had some free tickets because of going to Fantasies in Chocolate so we expected to go in, check out the place and then head out.  But instead we stayed for about an hour.  I did my white man overbite shuffle and then let my wife tear up the dance floor looking smoking hot and happy.  Nothing makes a man happier than seeing his wife enjoying herself.

We didn't get any drinks because we knew we would be driving soon enough, but I did get a few waters and the bar staff was super friendly and helpful and hardworking.  The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.

The music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.

This by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to ""da club"".

After doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.

Oh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy ""eyecandy"" up on platforms everywhere.  So he will be looking, it's only natural, if this will get you in a fight, go elsewhere.","Another great night at Dmitri's

1,"I don't know that I have a whole lot to say about India's Kitchen, except that it was a decent dinner.  Now don't take it to mean that I'm not giving praise.  After all, 3 stars does mean ""A-OK.""  But at the same time, I've eaten at a number of other Indian food restaurants that are as good or better.

For our visit, we shared a vegetable appetizer.  That was pretty good.  A nice variety of breaded & fried vegetable-based items, all ot and with generous ingredient quantity.  The rice for our entrees was good - delicate flavor and not sticky - like it should be.  My wife enjoyed here chicken tikka masala, and my daughter enjoyed her chicken mango.  I will shout out that the chicken in the chicken mango was extremely tender - but still firm and flavorful.  My goat curry had a good, typical flavor.  However, the volume of goat seemed a little skimpy when it arrived.  And it was more than 50% bone, meaning that I was left a little hungry.  That shouldn't happen.  The final item we ordered was naan for each of us.  The naan was excellent (I really like naan bread in general), but that is the case at most places.

the visit was enjoyable.  I'd go back again.  But I'm not of the opinion that this is the Indian restaurant that has to be near the top of my list.","Well the folks at Reeds sure hit a home run for us on our visit there.  Setting was enjoyable (tables are close together, but I don't care about that), service was extremely helpful and friendly, and the food was both surprising and highly delicious.

The space is pretty small, with a bar and a long row of tables along the wall (oh, and one free-standing table between the bar and the restrooms & kitchen.  However, there are stairs leading up to a second level that I was told more than doubles the seating capacity.  We were seated at the far end of the tables, toward the kitchen.  So with the noise of the restaurant, along with the sounds from the kitchen, it was fairly loud.  Not a problem, really - just had to raise our voices to converse.

Our waiter (along with the owner or manager) was great.  He checked to see if we had been there before (we hadn't) and then offered to quickly run through the menu and options.  We let him do so, and he was efficient & provided his thoughts/recommendations on the various dishes too.  They have a nice prix fixe option where you get an appetizer/small plate, entree, and dessert for $40.  We had a party of five and all went with that, allowing us to do a lot of sharing for the small plates to try all the unusual food choices.  We also started off with a bacon fat fried cornbread, and our waiter noted for us that it came with two pieces - so that we could decide to order two of them, and not have to fight or immediately order another one.  The pieces were pretty big, but so tasty that we definitely each wanted one (with just a bit of sharing to work for five people).  A nice touch throughout the evening was that as each course was completed, all the dishes and flatware were removed, with fresh flatware provided each time.

The food was just fantastic.  I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that.  The menu changes frequently (it is dated for the month), with local and seasonal ingredients.  And honestly, I was expecting typical American comfort food - but the menu items were far from plain choices.  We all ordered:

Appetizers/small plates - bacon fat fried cornbread (honey-thyme butter), roasted cauliflower (harissa, charmoula, red bell peppers & cilantro), roasted brussels ( bacon lardons, caramelized onions, currants, crispy panko crumble & malt vinegar aioli), ""shrimp & grits"" (shrimp crusted scallops, local grits, sauce americaine & arugula), braised beef cheek (oven dried tomatoes, arugula, focaccia & foie gras cream), morrell mushrooms (didn't get that description, since it wasn't on the online menu - only listed on the paper menu and only available for a few days).

Entrees - pastrami reuben (pork tongue, swiss, caraway-pickled cabbage, dijonnaise, dark rye & fries), chicken agnolotti (rouge blanc, shiitake mushrooms, leeks, croutons, parsley & lemon) - essentially chicken ravioli/dumplings, cioppino (scallops, mussels, red snapper, shrimp, tomato lobster broth, toasted french bread & saffron)

Desserts - banana panna cotta (rum caramel sauce, cashew brittle & cardamom whipped cream) - whipped bananas, chocolate flourless cake (toasted marshmallow fluff, graham cracker crumble & whipped cream)

So those menu descriptions sound pretentious to me - although not that unusual any more.  However, they really point out the complexity and richness of all of the items.  We all thought that each one was a good selection, and noted how much flavor they each had.  I really can't overemphasize that.  The sizes of the small plates were just what we expected.  The entree sizes for the chicken agnolotti and cioppino looked kind of small when they came out, but apparently that was just an illusion.  The three ladies each finished only half their chicken ""raviolis"".  They said it was really rich (I tasted one, and they were rich, but in a pleasant manner), and they were also full after just half.  My cioppino was also deceptive.  The bowl was filled with seafood, which also filled me by the time I finished.  The broth had an intriguing spice that wasn't hot, but did have my lips tingling a bit by the end.  The reuben and fries was huge.  Only one half the sandwich was eaten - it had a high pile of pastrami on it, and a great greasiness to it.  The amount of fries was almost embarrassingly large.  However, when you consider that the sandwich and fries cost $15, it should be that large.  We also noticed that a neighboring table's cheeseburger and fries was similar, with an extremely tall burger and a huge fries portion.

And the desserts - as we were eating it, I said to my dad that when I saw the banana plates, I felt like we were getting ripped off.  But again, it was deceptive.  What looked small on the plate again was filling, and filled with interesting flavor.  Same for a very well prepared chocolate flourless cake.

1,"Indoors, outdoors, for food, or for drinks: Chatham Tap does it all.

I have been here many times for dining and many times just for drinking and have never been disappointed. They have several vegetarian options and a great beer list. 

They tend to be pretty busy most of the time, so be patient if you don't find a seat right away. One will open up and it will be worth the wait. Because they are busy, the servers tend to be busy as well. They might not always see you if you are in need of something in between their normal rounds to your table, so if you need something during that time, nicely try to get their attention. That being said, between their normal rounds to your table, unless you are chugging, you most likely won't be on empty in your beer before you see them again. 

The garlic cheddar fries are pretty damn delicious and you can never go wrong with their homemade black bean burger.","I see i'm in the extreme minority here with my two star review. It seems everyone loves the food, but some had problems with service.

i've never had an issue with service (i've had their pizza about 10 times but was never involved in the actual getting of the pizza). 

What i do have an issue with is the pizza. I'm not going to say it's bad. It's not. but it's also not good, at least compared to most other pizza places in indy (not including stuff like domino's)

My biggest problem is the lack of flavor. I'll qualify this with my being a vegetarian so i've only ever had the cheese and the veggie pizzas. The cheese is ok. It's the best of the two. The veggie is covered with onions and green peppers. They're not shy with the toppings, which is good.

However, i'm one of those people that hates green peppers. I hate green peppers more than cats hate getting baths. I hate green peppers more than liberals and conservatives hate working together. I hate green peppers more than Buzz Aldrin hates the moon (i assume). Green peppers are in my top 3 of least favorite things i've ever eaten. 

Now that you understand how much i hate green peppers, i can tell you that i don't bother picking the green peppers off their pizza when the veggie is the option i'm faced with, because somehow the veggies on the pizza contain zero traces of flavor. i'm not sure where they get their veggies, but their vendor must launch the veggies into space where flavor stealing aliens suck all the flavor out, then gently parachute the veggies back down to their pizza. 

Honestly though, the pizza isn't bad. it just has no flavor. Their pasta, though, i can't say the same thing for. But i've only ever had their pasta twice, so maybe the aliens have started ignoring their pasta and it's better now.","Text1: Indoors, outdoors, for food, or for drinks: Chatham Tap does it all.

Now that you understand how much i hate green peppers, i can tell you that i don't bother picking the green peppers off their pizza when the veggie is the option i'm faced with, because somehow the veggies on the pizza contain zero traces of flavor. i'm not sure where they get their veggies, but their vendor must launch the veggies into space where flavor stealing aliens suck all the flavor out, then gently parachute the veggies back down to their pizza. 

Honestly though, the pizza isn't bad. it just has no flavor. Their pasta, though, i can't say the same thing for. But i've only ever had their pasta twice, so maybe the aliens have started ignoring their pasta and it's better now.",yes

Brought it home and it did not work. I tightened up everything, and it still did not work.
I got into the car, drove over to Home Depot and went into plumbing.
There, a very nice young man tried to help me but could not.
So he suggested we go to garden and speak to Dave..  in the young man's words, ""Dave is the most asked for employee here.""

When Dave saw me, and heard my dilemma, again, he found the answer.
In about 30 seconds.
He solved my problem, he gifted me with the item, and off I went --- back home to deal with my problem.

We went on a first Thursday = free admission! some of the Lilly house is being renovated until May, so we didn't get to go upstairs and the pop up shop with the Orchids was double the price of Home Depot ones (which I purchased from Home Depot when I left lol) Can't wait until the Beer Garden opens at the end of this month!","I think every speciality hobby should have a speciality shop like Provisions. A great place to browse and argue with the owner over Ladurée vs Pierre Hermé macarons, it has raised the bar of Edmonton in ways only Duchess bakeshop had, in the past.  

The ingredients available here are the best you can ask for. They are the best there is. While the store is clean and organized, don't be fooled by its size. There are lots of things available here, whether you like to bake cookies, cakes, make ice creams and gelatos, bake brioches, or are a recipe book hoarder.  Get your Anita's flour (super expensive, but excellent) here, or your bergamot extract - because we all need that, don't we? ;-) - or, a good quality baker's blade! 

The best thing about this store is that they carry the highest quality products in every department of baking. Instead of spending hours sifting through pointless books on baking, they just carry the best ones here. Of course, while they are the best in my opinion, they also tend to be some of the most traditional and painstaking ways of making things. 

I believe they are the only shop in Edmonton that sells patinas. I've looked for bread patinas for a while, so this was a great find for me.

1,"Mmmmmmmmm....

That is my first response to my Sunday brunch experience.  There were so many yummy things to choose from that we over ordered and took it home.

General Tso's wings.  Delicious.   Just the wasabi blue cheese sauce is enough to to give it a 4 star rating.

Blue Duck Fries - love the duck confit with the smoked Gouda cheese sauce.   It brings fries to a whole new stratum

Duck Benedict - eggs were a bit on the runny side but the sriracha Cherry hollandaise makes it fabulous.

Duck a l'orange- thin pancakes with duck and blood orange syrup.   This was good but not as good as the other things, but then I like thick pancakes.

Nonetheless I will be back to try other things on the menu.

The music here was very loud but the atmosphere rustic, though fresh and bright featuring a concrete floor that had been epoxied over and wooden tables.  Two large screen TVS dominate the space.  Tables are close.

Look out for the creepy mannequin in the back if you head back to the restroom.   Reservations are advisable.  Not the place to bring grandma.   More the spot for hipsters and empty nesters who still have their hearing","Stopped in here on my way back from the shore and wanted to compare this one to the Exton location.

First of all, the decor is a bit more upscale and fresher.   1970s and 1980s rock plays in the dining room.  The menu is much more limited in terms of items on the menu and seems to only have the traditional Chinese items.  One of the specials was Dry Pepper Intestines.  There are a few exceptions and they are listed under categories such as ""Kids/Baby Adults.""  

We again ordered the dumplings in chili oil.   Very different from the other location where we got six wonton shaped dumplings as opposed to the ten half-moon shaped ones here with a bit more garnish.    The black bean style shrimp here had many more fermented black beans and the Kung Pao chicken was quite good here and there We also ordered the house fried rice- ok but nothing to write home about -as well as the garlic chicken which was great.   

Serving sizes were large.  Service was fine.  The cost was $90 with a 20% tip and no beverages.","Text1: Mmmmmmmmm....

0,"To add to the already abundant selection of sub/sandwich places in a 1 mile radius, we now have PJ Subs (like it says on the menu) or T6 like it says on the front of the restaurant.  After kicking out my favorite wing joint, I just had to see if it was worth it..

They remodeled the store, adding central air conditioning, painting the walls, making the entrance ""prettier,"" decorating the walls with classic car paraphernalia, and most importantly, cleaning the bathroom.  They have new chairs and shiny new tables.

The front of the store has a neon lit sign that says 76.  Nowhere that I can find does it say PJ Subs other than on the front of the menu.  So really, I don't know what this place is called.  After hours of deliberation with my friend's roommate, we came to the conclusion that the ""76"" is actually a ""T6,"" which would stand for Tucson and 6th, the location of this sub joint.

Their menu consists of subs (cold or hot, from $5-8) and sides.  In addition they have salads and wings.  The bread is baked fresh, the vegetables are fresh, and the meats and cheeses are high quality.

My favorite is ""The Regular"" which has salami, capicolla, provolone, and the standard lettuce/tomato/onion.  They also put oil/vinegar on it and I asked for mayo (no charge).  It was presented open faced and looked very appetizing.  I could taste the quality in the meats and this was not as greasy as Silvermine or Jimmy John's version of the same sandwich.  Most of the cold sandwiches are a different combination of the same meats and cheeses, I've tried all of them and can't distinguish a huge difference in any of them.

The wings are alright, good enough to validate eating fried fat but not good enough to eat them alone as a meal.  The garlic bread is another item to miss.

PJ's officially opened on Monday, 1/5, and are still under construction.  The front of the store is complete, but they're still working on the heaters and a beer area in the back.

In addition they will offer a selection of wines.","The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is that I think it's a little overpriced.

Our room was very nice and comfortable w/ a nice view of the fountain.  They offer a brakfast in the morning w/ several good options.  My husband says that he wishes that they would just offer eggs sometimes...just plain eggs w/o the add ins.  But, they have cereal, oatmeal, fruit, toast, bagels, muffins, real waffles (not the conveyor belt pancakes), coffee, tea, cocoa and juices.  There is a nice excercise room w/ treadmill, elliptical, weights, kettle balls, yoga ball, weighted balls.  There is also an outside pool.

0,"I walked passed this restaurant every day for a whole year and never had the chance to try it until a friend of mine scheduled a happy hour gathering here one afternoon. 

There were 8 of us seated at our table, and it wasn't until after we arrived that we discovered the happy hour special on drinks was only available at the bar. This was not advertised anywhere on the menu or website. But it's not like all 8 of us could go sit at the bar and converse comfortably, so we chose to stay seated and pay full price for our drinks. That was strike 1. 

Our group trickled in in pairs every 10 minutes or so (people coming in after work or classes), and when we tried to order 5 dishes earlier on to share, the waitress told us she could only put in one full order, for the whole table, one time. I found her tone to be somewhat rude. She also said each person usually ordered 2-3 dishes on their own...but our party was there for HH, not necessarily dinner. So we waited 30 minutes for the the whole party to arrive to order the original 5 dishes anyway. Strike 2. Everyone ordered an oyster slider, which was great - probably my favorite thing on their menu, but $6 is pretty steep for a sandwich barely the size of my palm. We also got the hot chicken, shrimp and grits, mac and cheese, and the pork belly. The hot chicken was so spicy one of my friends couldn't eat any more after the first bite, but everything else was fairly yummy. The dishes are tiny though, and to think they cost $15 a piece...

With all the food and drinks combined, each person ended up paying around $20+, but our stomachs were still grumbling and we were so dissatisfied with the service that we moved our party elsewhere down the street.","This is like an adorable little neighbourhood market that you would find in a chic area of New York. It's all organic, health foodie, trendy, the staff is a bit aloof, and all of the customers in line at the till are madly trolling their Instagram accounts. 

The produce is great, the meat looks amazing at the meat counter. There are lots of unusual or not normally found (in a regular store) ""health conscience"" snacks, etc. The prices are higher then discount stores - but that is to be expected. The one thing that most likely will deter me from being a regular customer is that I just don't live on Whyte. It's a bit of a stretch to drive to a very busy area of town, where it is quite hard to find parking, just to go to an organic market. But, on a day like today when I had a biz meeting at Da Capo and was already parked near by... Well then that makes it quite easy!  

I suggest make a day of it: Meet a friend for lunch at Under The High Wheel, go to a yoga class up-stairs, stroll Whyte, people watch, grab an espresso at Da Capo, then get groceries and go home!

0,"Updating my review. 4 stars for ""I'm a fan"". This is because I know what I'm getting into. Value Mexican-America/TexMex food right in the heart of Fountain Square. The taste is solid. It's not one of the local taquerias where you can have your selection of 5-6 meats for tacos but it's also not one of the bougie ""mexican"" places run by white folks who can afford flights to Mexico to steal recipes from local folks (like some Indy places). Price-wise, it is your best option in Fountain Square. The salsa is AMAZING and the family-owned place is friendly.","My review of Marrakesh should really be broken into two parts- one for people who haven't experienced Moroccan restaurants and another for people who have.

For those of you who have never been to ANY Moroccan restaurants, lemme break this shiz down for you.  So you show up and they seat you at a big round table, low to the ground, with nice cushy pillows on your seats.  The meal is broken into 7 parts, all of which are eaten with your hands or using pita (with the exception of the couscous).  First is cold dips- hummus (at some places, not all), baba ghanoush, marinated carrots, and cucumber salad.  The second is something called a bastilla, which is a phyllo dough stuffed with egg, chicken and nuts, and covered in powdered sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Courses three and four are meat courses- can be kabobs, roast chicken, lamb, (or veggie options, for you plant-eating folks).  The fifth course is couscous.  The sixth course is fresh fruit.  And the final seventh course is baklava and mint tea.  Sound good?  Damn right it sounds good.  And if you are lucky, you will be treated with a belly dancing show.  Ooh la la.

For those people who have already popped their bastilla cherry, I can tell you that Marrakesh is a pretty standard Moroccan joint but definitely my favorite in the city.  I really like that it is multiple levels, so each table feels very cozy and private.  One downfall of the multiple levels is that when the belly dancer comes out, you can only see her if she's in your section (unlike Casablanca in NE Philly that is more open AND has a male dancer, but that's for another review).  And its location right off South Street gives you easy access to continue the party after dinner. 

Food wise, Marrakesh is definitely the better of the Moroccan places in Philly.  Marrakesh does not have hummus in their first course, however the baba ghanoush more than makes up for that.  On our last visit, we got the spicy chicken and the lamb with almonds.  Both were delicious- the chicken had a nice kick to it and was super juicy.  The lamb was both savory and sweet at the same time.   Yum!

Marrakesh is best visited with a group- great place for a double or triple date.  Or a girls night out.  Make sure to bring booze, as this spot is BYOB.  And also make sure to bring some cash, because they don't take credit.  And make sure to do some sit-ups if you want to challenge the dancer to a belly dance-off.","Text1: Updating my review. 4 stars for ""I'm a fan"". This is because I know what I'm getting into.

I learned from past experiences to not eat certain chicken dishes in the mall food court anymore. Now I may come back to try their bourbon chicken because that's a classic and I have not eaten it in years, seems I only see it once in a blue moon. I have to say that the portions are good and I didn't mind the prices. I notice they keep their food trays stocked fresh-n-hot, which is good.","Probably the perfect ""cakery"" in the planet.

This place is one of those places that you will probably see in the big metro spaces in the country. It's beautifully designed and no expense was spared. From carerra marble tables to monogrammed champagne flutes, this place is a sight to see.

As for cakes, expect to splurge. Don't be all cheap. Expect little less than $10 for a slice of cake. My fave is the owner's fave as well which is the caramel cake. All I can say is omg-  where has this place been. It looks ordinary but definitely a winner in the taste department. I can honestly say that this is probably my favorite cake ever.","Text1: My nephew likes to go here for the bourbon chicken and I give the kid what he wants.

1,"2.5 stars.

I wandered in here tonight after getting lost and very, very wet. I stood at the hostess/Please wait to be seated table and no one bothered to make eye contact with me or acknowledged me. Went to the bathroom and came back. Again no acknowledgement until the bartender asked if I needed to be seated. I had the choice of a small table sanwiched right in the middle of a bunch of tables or the bar. I chose the bar.

I ordered a Paulaner and the Copa burger with Spanish fries. The Paulaner came pretty fast and was pretty tasty. It's always nice when you find a place that cleans their taplines. Too many places around here don't. The Copa burger and fries came out after a bit. The fries were smokin' hot so I ate a good portion of the burger first. The Copa burger comes with mild green chiles, Monterey Jack,  and bacon on it. The chiles were decent, as was the cheese and bacon. Unfortunately my burger, which I ordered medium well to hopefully get medium, was more like medium rare. Lots of pink and juices. I like a little juice but not that much. The fries were decent but I'm not sure they were ""award winning"". And how serving fries with little green chiles and fried onions counts as being Spanish, I don't know.

The service was ok, but not that great. It took a long time to get a second beer. It seemed like they were understaffed for how many people were there. That and/or I was getting ignored. 

I might come back again and see if this was just an off night. Right now I""m thinking it might be a place to get a beer and go somewhere else for dinner.","Ode to a gourmet convenience store:

Ahh foodery you wreck me. So many good things, so little money. Indie domestic beers, german beers, belgian beers, in row after row of malted/hoppy goodness. You're sandwiches made fresh on the spot are delightful. Your salsa is hot and spicy.  Your chips are natural and delicious. Your ice cream bars are tasty and full of chocolaty/creamy goodness.

My entree was pretty OK, nothing amazing. I'd love to come back and try more things, though.

Stacey, the owner, and Beetle Juice (her partner in crime, a black pug herself) have taken such great care of him. When Bunk started out, he was the most playful puppy in the whole world. He needed constant entertainment, ate everything that was in front of him (clothes, wallets, food, poop, etc.) and we had no idea what to do with him when we went to work for 12 hours a day. 

We looked all over Nashville and most of the doggy daycare places we  visited left much to be desired. Some smelled like poop while others simply did not clean. What is the use of being able to see my dog on the webcam walking through his own poop? Sigh. We then stumbled upon doggy rotten. We told ourselves that this is the last place we will see and then we're heading back home. I was super impressed to walk in through their doors and smell CANDLES. Yes, delicious candles. They had super cute decor and it was apparent that someone had put lots of thought into it. Stacey greeted us and talked to us for a while, answering all our questions. 

We were a little worried that Bunk was tiny and that Doggy Rotten kept small and big dogs at the same place but this was not an issue at all. Bunk has been going here for three years and really, he is friends with a Newfoundland, German Shepherd, Pug and Bulldog. 

What we truly appreciate about Stacey is the way in which she puts lots of personal touches to her business. She wipes the dogs at the end of the day and sprays them down so that they always smell fresh. There is 24 hours supervision. Bunk is ALWAYS around someone, not lonesomely looking at a webcam. She feeds them organic treats. She takes lots of pictures of them during Christmas, Thanksgiving, St.Patrick's Day, etc . and sends them my way. This makes me feel like a good mother who leaves her baby with a lovely friend! 

When no one out there would board Bunk because he was too hyper, Stacey took care of him since my partner was sick. She even drove him home. Bunk ate her wallet and blanket. Her response? Stacey said we could leave Bunk with her for a month while we go on our honeymoon. Bunk will sleep on her bed and we will be completely carefree as we travel because we know we left him with the best friend he could have.

0,"Pancake house by day, steakhouse by night!  If you have read any of the other reviews (particularly for Gaucho Steakhouse), then you will see there have been a number of bewildered guests that have dined here.  The family that owns this brunch restaurant closes the place at 3, cleans up, and then reopens as Gaucho Brazilian Steakhouse at 5 pm.  Both restaurants use the same entrance and space, but the signs over the entrance make it look like the pancake house is on the left and the steakhouse is on the right.  Just go to the left, regardless of when you dine here.

Okay, so the space inside is not designed for clearing things up.  There are large murals on the walls celebrating breakfast and area sports teams.  And there are posters about steak as well.  The space is broken up into two shotgun style dining areas.  The one on the entrance side has a number of tables and a bar area towards the back.  The space to the right is divided by a mirrored wall that is lined with booth seating for the tables that are located there.  Pull out chairs sit on the opposite sides of the bench seating.   

Anyway, I ordered my brunch selection and a bottomless cup of coffee and was generally pleased.  The ""Original Benny"" came with two poached eggs, a buttery Hollandaise sauce, English muffin halves, and Canadian bacon.  Pretty well executed and tasty.  On the same plate, some crisped hash browns came with the order to help mop up any of the sauce left over.  On a side plate, a colorful fresh fruit plate offered melon, red grapes, and orange slices.

The service was okay....efficient comes to mind.  Not a lot of interaction or welcoming attitude.  I could understand if it was a busy day, but the room seemed less than half full.

Overall, if you are hungry, the food is good and you just have to trust the staff to lead you to seating.  Don't over think it.

Review #503","Had a really good ""Cheesesteak Gringo Burrito"" a week or two ago. Though, I still am not compelled to truly embrase this place. Also had a Spiced Mexican Sangria. Both were quite atypical, creative and pretty good.

The cheesesteak burrito had, you guessed it, cheesesteak. Though, not what you'd typically expect. The pieces were thicker. It was the meat in a unauthentic rendition of a cheesesteak in Old City or some far off city: terrible in something passable for a good cheesesteak but pretty good in a dish clearly attempting to break away from the namesake.","Text1: Pancake house by day, steakhouse by night!  If you have read any of the other reviews (particularly for Gaucho Steakhouse), then you will see there have been a number of bewildered guests that have dined here.  The family that owns this brunch restaurant closes the place at 3, cleans up, and then reopens as Gaucho Brazilian Steakhouse at 5 pm.  Both restaurants use the same entrance and space, but the signs over the entrance make it look like the pancake house is on the left and the steakhouse is on the right.  Just go to the left, regardless of when you dine here.

Okay, so the space inside is not designed for clearing things up.  There are large murals on the walls celebrating breakfast and area sports teams.  And there are posters about steak as well.  The space is broken up into two shotgun style dining areas.  The one on the entrance side has a number of tables and a bar area towards the back.  The space to the right is divided by a mirrored wall that is lined with booth seating for the tables that are located there.  Pull out chairs sit on the opposite sides of the bench seating.   

Anyway, I ordered my brunch selection and a bottomless cup of coffee and was generally pleased.  The ""Original Benny"" came with two poached eggs, a buttery Hollandaise sauce, English muffin halves, and Canadian bacon.  Pretty well executed and tasty.  On the same plate, some crisped hash browns came with the order to help mop up any of the sauce left over.  On a side plate, a colorful fresh fruit plate offered melon, red grapes, and orange slices.

1,"I love Tex Mex.  Love it!  And I love SATCo's take on it.  For a fair price, you can enjoy delicious tacos, queso and an adult beverage on a sunny afternoon on the SATCo porch.  And I am all for that!

Their speed in preparing your order is something to be reckoned with.  I think I blinked and saw my plate sitting on the counter.  Maybe they could have a showdown with Jimmy Johns!

What wonderful combination of Tex Mex did I enjoy on this cool Friday afternoon?  I'm glad you asked!  I enjoyed a quickly but carefully made ground beef taco (hard shell) and fish taco (soft shell).  Both were flavorful and had a great mix of textures.  But nothing beats the queso.  Nothing, I say!!  I'm usually a white queso snob, but this yellow-orange cheesy goodness has changed me for the better.  Spicy.  Cheesy.  Delicious.

As much as I like this place, their biggest pitfall is the parking.  It's pretty much awful.  But for a good queso fix, it's worth it!","The Pancake Pantry is a well-oiled machine.  That is, if well-oiled machines make delicious pancakes with a variety of wonderful flavors, toppings and textures.  After my first visit to this devinely old-school style establishment, I think I have come up with a way to maximize the experience.  And thus, I provide you with a how-to guide for Pancake Pantry:

1. Dress appropriately for the weather and for your belly.  If it is summer, wear light, breathable clothing.  If it is winter, pack on the warm layers.  And whatever the weather is, ensure your belt can withstand the intake of this deliciously filling meal.

2. Have one member of your party (the one with the least amount of tolerance for waiting) go to Fido's to get everyone coffee.

3. People watch. Enjoy the day. Know that the line you are waiting in is well worth what is in store for you once you cross over to the great indoors.

4. Once you arrive inside, sit down and look at your long list of incredibly flavored pancakes.  Find the one that looks amazing, and go with your gut.  No matter what you choose, you just will not be disappointed here.

5. Last but not least, don't be discouraged when you read that there will be FIVE pancakes on your plate.  They are not the size of your face, like other diners.

6. Do not weigh yourself for the rest of the day.  You experienced something amazing.  Pancakes made with real ingredients.  And love.

1,"I'm going to say something that's going to make every provel-loving, Cardinals-worshiping, toasted-ravioli-eating, red-blooded St. Louisan want to punch me in the face. 

Ted Drewes WISHES it could be as good as Mr. Wizard's. Yeah, I said it. 

I hoofed it over to Mr. Wizard's tonight for some pre-race fuel. What, no one else scarfs down custard the day before a half-marathon? 

I wanted to keep things simple, so I went with a vanilla Oreo concrete. No frills, no bells and whistles. Just plain vanilla custard with tons of oreo chunks mixed in. 

My order was ready before I could shove my wallet back in my purse. Speedy! 

And...oh my...this, my friends, is what custard is supposed to taste like. No soupy mess that melts in 10 seconds. No flavorless custard that NEEDS toppings mixed in to taste like anything. 

This is the real deal. Creamy, rich, flavorful custard that refuses to melt right away. I turned my cup upside down, just for kicks. It didn't budge. Sweet. I noticed that Ted Drewes doesn't even bother to do that anymore when they serve it to you. I wonder why...

Anyway, back to Mr. Wizard's. They offer a ton of mix-ins, and if you're into specialty concretes, they offer those as well. They also serve sno cones, and if you're really weird...errr...daring, they offer sno cones with custard mixed in? I don't get it. 

Anyway, this spot is the real deal. Ted Drewes comparisons aside, this custard spot stands on it's own.","When I lost my favorite pair of black-rimmed glasses, I knew I needed to find a new pair, and fast. I was wearing my (really ugly) pair of backup glasses in the meanwhile, and for someone who's trying to get her groove back, it just wasn't working out. 

So to The Eye Bar I went. 

While I'm really good at going to the dentist every 6 months, the doctor once a year, and getting my oil changed every 3 months, I suck at making regular eye appointments. The last time I had an eye exam was at least 5 years ago. Oops! 

Thankfully, The Eye Bar has an optometrist on site. I made an eye appointment online and was set. 

The day of my appointment, I walked in and was warmly greeted by the employees. I was led downstairs to the exam room. The doctor was super nice and professional, and the eye exam went smoothly. 

Now time for the fun part!  The Eye Bar has a TON of awesome and unique frames. I sat in a chair, and the employees brought me pair after pair of glasses to try on. It was so much fun! I felt like I had my own personal shoppers. 

Eventually, I narrowed it down to three frames. It was a tough decision, but they took a few pictures of me wearing each pair, which helped immensely. Looking in the mirror is one thing; seeing yourself in a picture is different somehow. 

I ended up with a super sweet pair of specs that I'm absolutely IN LOVE with. And it's a good thing I'm so enamored with them -- the price for the frames + lenses was DEFINITELY not cheap! Ouch. 

I received my brand new glasses about 5 days later (they send the frames off to get the lenses installed -- they don't do it on-site). They gave me a glasses case, glasses cleaner (that I'll receive free refills on for life), and told me about the two year scratch warranty that comes with every pair of specs purchased from The Eye Bar. Sweet. 

The best part of the visit? After I picked out my glasses, we celebrated with an ice cold corona. YES, The Eye Bar has a mini-fridge with various alcoholic bevvies. I don't know why that tickled me so much, but it did.

The next time I treat myself to a new pair of glasses, I know exactly where I'll be heading.","Text1: I'm going to say something that's going to make every provel-loving, Cardinals-worshiping, toasted-ravioli-eating, red-blooded St. Louisan want to punch me in the face.

The patty was the star, though it was more of a medium rare. Still, it was deliciously beefy, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, and properly seasoned. The brioche bun did a good job of sopping up the juices but got messy after a while. Truffle fries were shatteringly crisp on the outside with creamy insides and the perfect amount of salt, excellent dipped in their fry sauce.

I did have a couple gripes. The boar bacon tasted great but resembled leather texturally, and the cook went a little overboard with the truffle oil on my fries.

1,"My wife brings home this big to-go box.  After sitting in the fridge for a couple of days, she asks ""do you want to try an oyster???""  That like asking superman if he wants kryptonite because I have gout amd the high protein content 19-22g in 1 oyster can literally make it where I can't walk.

When I saw the shrimp (more like prawns)--I was astonished.  Then when I looked at a fried oyster that was so lightly breaded you could see the details of it through the batter.   Add to that a homemade tartar sauce with the perfect amount of dill, and even an ice cold fried leftover was delectable.   It didn't even compare to Mandina's on Canal St.

The food can only get better when fishermen start going from boat to market in Lafitte.  

Once I was working on grand isle and a man asked a mini-mart clerk ""where's the fishing dock?""  She said ""there is no dock, they (boat) 40 minutes to the seafood market on hwy 90 in westwego!, that's where all the seafood goes.....""

Lafitte is building a seafood market where you can unload your boat and move your catch 50 ft. To a stand.  Westwego is building a new seafood market on the other side of hwy 90 in ""historic salaville.""

In terms of an 80 year old trying to relive the glory days, westwego wins.  

When you look at economics and convenience, Leo Kerner and the people of Lafitte are going to win bigtime, along with fresh picks for this restaurant that I have yet to visit!!!!!","They close at 8.  Walked in at 7:30.  Real cool people, no kids, no line, and really good snoballs.

I didn't have any waiting, running, or screaming.  
They waited on me to decide and it only took a few minutes to get the order.  Adding another pic of the menu is futile.  The homemade cheesecake stuffing is ultimate.

1,"Coral hooked it up with a $50 cut and color. At first I was sceptical about the price because as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for,"" but that wasn't the case.

My ends were really damaged from all the coloring I do so sadly she had to cut them off, but she offers a product for hair growth or eyelash growth of you want longer eyelashes.

Khol's always has good deals going on. I like the whole ""spend $50, get $10 in Khol's cash"" thing they have going on.

Food - The Friday Pasta special is my usual dish. Good blend of lettuce as a salad base with penne. The balsamic sauce was on the side which was great for me. Finally, this past Sunday it was served HOT, not stone cold. In fact, after 30 min of running errands, it was still warm when I got home so it must've been hot.

If you recognize the name in Birmingham, go to 1 of those locations and get to experience the real Taziki's brand. I leave Nashville in a few months and I definitely hope this location can mimic its great sister locations throughout the South.","Text1: Easy in & out location.

Wish this place was still BYO, but things change.
It always helps when you serve Sarcone's bread, and certainly you will not leave here wanting more. The portions are very large, the calamari was enough for 2 or maybe 3.
It came out hot, not greasy or chewy. The salads are also large, but the dressing was a bit much for my taste.
The pasta was cooked al dente, and the veal was tender. Sauces for both dishes were spicy and plentiful.
That being said, there are a couple drawbacks to this place. IF the weather permits, you are much better sitting outside, since its crowded and quite loud inside. While the food is above an average Italian restaurant, it seemed like they lay on the cheese and sauces a bit heavy.
Yes, it's nice they give you a Lemoncello shot after dinner, and the service was friendly, even though they were crowded. I would say the pasta at Avalon a few blocks away is superior, but overall Lemoncello is good and especially for families.","Oh Philly, I miss you and your indifferent baristas. I promised my niece that we'd go out for coffee when I was visiting, and we decided to hit the city. This place is open late on weekends, so we grabbed some cookies and coffee and settled in to talk about college and internships. It wasn't crowded--just a few folks with laptops.

The hotel also has direct access to Landry's and Hard Rock Cafe right outside the rear entrance.  Valet and Check-in went very smoothly and the room itself was very clean and nice.  The hotel does have a twist and turn maze-like layout so you need to pay close attention to the directional signs.  The bed was pretty comfortable and the pillows are nice.  I ordered room service the next morning, which only took 30 min for delivery.  3 egg omelet w/potatoes.  I requested a side of salsa, but got a side of sausage instead, hmph.  I didn't send it back though...  Also, didn't get my toast.  haha, probably didn't need the carbs anyway.  So, I'd suggest double checking your order. 

1 complaint... the heat wasn't heating too well in the room.  I had the temp cranked up to 80, but the room only ever reached 71 degrees.  I had to use my coat as additional cover to warm me up.  I did bring this to the hotel staff attention as I checked out and they promptly compensated me for the trouble which was great.  I'd definitely stay here again, overall the stay was good, staff friendly and food fresh.","This is called a South Philadelphia hoagie....!!!!! If you want a grand experience with fireworks blasting come to Ricci's!! My dad brought me here as a young girl (he made me the Foodie I am today, lol) after school me still in my Catholic school uniform and we ordered the best hoagie ever....

The wait is quick and everyone just forms a line and they make your hoagie assembly line style. My favorite is the lady in there she looks like Sandra bullock she is very nice....

I have sat in each level of CBP and have moved between sections each season.  There is not a bad seat in the park and everyone has their favorite section/area for different reasons.

Chickie's is still at the ballpark --- they were moved to a larger area across from their old location to accommodate the crowds lusting after their crab fries.  CBP has good items for vegetarians and vegans, as well as those with Celiac.  

Plenty of merchandise options, of course, as well as a caricature artist on the 100 level.  

Aramark is official concession provider.  Their prices are outrageous.  

Tip:  you're allowed to bring bottled beverages and food into CBP.  See the Phillies web site for specifics.

1,"Armed with a LivingSocial deal, we came by for dinner before heading to the Avenue of the Arts just 1 block away.  Don't judge the quality of the sushi by it's slightly sketchy looking website or less-than-sleek store sign - the sushi is great.

We got a variety of standard rolls, which had generous portions of fresh fish.  The Reverse Maki (rice on the outside) tend to have more fish than the Hoso Maki (seaweed on the outside), so opt for the former. The Salmon/Avocado was particularly good, although the Yellowtail/Avocado and the Spicy Tuna were also solid choices.  

I'll be back to try one of the sushi entrees!","Jones' has a great, low-key vibe albeit office-style arm chairs that are impossible to move.  The menu has a list of comfort foods that sound great, even though you feel like you should be able to make them at home (e.g., grilled cheese and mac 'n cheese). 

I had the calamari salad which had a nice smoky chipotle dressing over fresh greens and sweet corn--the only disappointing part was the I was eating cold fried calamari mixed in.  If the calamari had been grilled and more tender, I think this could have been a really great entree.  The drink list has some fun options, with the Bubbly Breeze being a light and enjoyable thirst-quencher.","Text1: Armed with a LivingSocial deal, we came by for dinner before heading to the Avenue of the Arts just 1 block away.

0,"I must say I was not impressed by this sushi restaurant. I have been waiting to hit a new spot so I could supply a whole new Yelp review, and this one is going to honestly be very negative.

First of all, let me just say that the interior of this establishment is very nice, the wall decorations and ceilings are decorated nicely, but once you get past that there is nothing good to say about Tsunami Sushi. A local supermaket, Publix, carries Tsunami sushi, and since it tastes so good at Publix, I assumed that the sushi would taste good at Tsunami sushi, and I was WRONG!

I had some eggrolls for an appetizer, which were decent, but nothing too special. You shouldn't bother paying the five dollars for them.

The sushi here was pretty bland, even my personal favorite the California, in freshness was not able to even remotely capture my taste buds at all. I tired some other rolls there like their Volcano Rolls and Philadelphia Rolls, but both were a disappointment and overall WASTE OF MONEY for the heavy price the restaurant charges.

My step-father, George Saunders, had their Korean Super Spicy dish and I must say that it was kickin'. I could smell it all the way from my side of the table, it left him feeling pretty sick the next day, but thats his own fault haha. 

Overall the bill was around $60, which wouldn't be bad if the sushi was great, but since it wasn't this place was a waste of time, and I would have been better off just going to Publix and buying the sushi from there! Big NO NO.","You know they are authentic when they only accept cash. Their lunch is always super busy. I love their pho and spring rolls. The service is ok( just like most Asian restaurants, the service is kinda disorganized) and they normally only have one waitress. Also their food is affordable. When we have cash on hand this is always the place for Asian food.","Text1: I must say I was not impressed by this sushi restaurant.

1,"We decided to check out The Good Pie after our friend from Italy gave it high praise.  The place is located Downtown on Olive and the area there is really developing so it's a great spot.

The inside is very welcoming and casual....lots of brick and wood and decorated with vintage bicycles.   This is not a large place but there were plenty of tables and even a nice patio outside where we noticed that they were growing fresh vegetables and herbs.

Our waitress seemed a little new but was very nice.  We ordered 2 pizzas and a starter of an olive sampler (yum!!)
The pizzas were The Good Pie and the Mushroom.  The crust is made there in their oven and is thin but soft and airy.  
The Good Pie was our favorite since we LOVE the sauce....and the mushrooms were heaven on the other one but there wasn't any sauce, only cheese....so maybe next time we'll combine them if that's allowed.

Everything was wonderful and we'll definitely be back!  I'll post photos later tonight.","Headed to Nadines for the 1st time to say Happy Birthday to a friend who was having a party there.  This is a two section type neighborhood pub and we sat in the section with the bar.  The other half contained more tables and was a good area to have a party.
We got a table and were greeted right away.  Our server was very attentive and nice and she took great care of us. 
We ordered drinks but they were off....maybe the soda machine was running out of syrup or something.    We drank them anyway since they weren't terrible and we didn't feel like trying again.
We got a Mushroom Swiss Burger which was very good w/ fresh mushrooms (not the canned variety) but I really didn't like the huge bun which was a bit too firm.
I ordered my burger w/ mashed potatoes and wished they were more than just potatoes mashed up, but didn't mind seasoning them up myself and they did come w/ gravy.
My friends got the fried calamari and the fried zucchini....both very typical and just alright.  If you'd like to see photos....I added them to the album.

I probably won't be back, but only because it was pretty smokey and I'm so used to the smoke-free places now.","Text1: We decided to check out The Good Pie after our friend from Italy gave it high praise.

1,"I had a hankering for tacos but didn't wanna drive to Jarocho or risk calling Taco Loco and finding out they were closed so I figured I'd try this little unassuming place I drive past on Dickinson all the time.  I placed an order for takeout and was told it would only be 5-10 minutes which is always nice.  I walked over there, noticing how cute and homey the place was and picked up my (cheap) food.  3 tacos and a Jarrito only came to like 9 bucks.  The tacos were pretty good, not as flavorful and juicy as Jarocho's steak tacos, but with all the fixins'- cilantro and onion and lime on the side.  I would definitely try their other dishes here.  For the price and speed of takeout, it's totally worth it.","The burger was delicious, yes, and the duck fat french fries with the cheese sauce were bangin', but would I go back?  Probably not.

$67 for two burgers (one with cheddar and bacon and the other with caramelized onions and bleu cheese), french fries, and 2 Magners ciders is hard to justify, even if the burger was perfectly cooked.

Like most of the other reviews on here, my boyfriend and I were split on the choice of bun, which I think was a potato roll dipped in butter.  Personally, I absolutely loved how it almost became mushy and blended with the burger and the butter taste complimented the salty/smoky flavor of my bleu cheese.  My boyfriend hated it and said it was like a store bought potato roll and fell under the weight of the hefty burger.

The chef definitely cooked our burger medium rare, exactly as we ordered it.  The toppings were good, but not great, which is disappointing when everything's a la carte, ranging anywhere from 2 to 5 bucks.  I could have used another spoonful of bleu cheese and onions and they could have just skipped the tomato, which wasn't even ripe.  The bibb lettuce was a nice change of pace, though.

Fries were good with the cheese sauce, but honestly if you gave me a blind taste test of Five Guys v. Village Whiskey, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference, which I guess is a good thing since Five Guys reigns supreme with their fries.  But again, I wouldn't pay $8 for it (and split between two people, it goes fast...they don't give you much).

Ambience was really what threw me off.  Guy in front of us was told it would be an hour wait for three people (on a Monday night? really?), so we opted for the ""counter"" style service which got us right in without a wait.  Once I was inside, I realized why the wait was so long.  It was like the size of the row home living rooms I've lived in in college.  Definitely need more seating to accomodate everyone.

I did feel like I was sitting in a bathroom the whole time, not only because we sat right next to one, but because they could have interchanged the tables and chairs with a toilet and a bathtub and it would have fit perfectly with the checkered tile and pipes theme.

Before crossing the Huey P was a nerve wracking event. Narrow lanes combined with unskilled drivers results in stress, panic, and road rage. The new, improved bridge is much, much better than it used to be. No longer do I fear death while driving over it! How's that for an endorsement?","Nataly N continued to amaze me for my birthday weekend with another surprise dinner.  This time, we dined alone ;)

Aldine had been on my to-try nearly since it opened.  They offer three courses, plus dessert, and drinks via their a la carte menu.  As I've always preferred a variety of food versus a huge portion of one dish when dining out, their type of menu plays to my preferences.  

We each began with a cocktail and first.  I cannot recall the name of my cocktail, but you'll know it as the one with tequila, watermelon, and a chilli pepper spice.  The spice was not overpowering, but did help ensure I didn't down the drink in one go!  As for our firsts, we shared the beets and corn + truffle custard.  The beet salad came with a cashew butter that helped balance the ingredients.  The custard appeared simple and straight forward, but after tasting I realized it had 'a lot going on' with bits of mushroom and tomato.

Instead of each ordering a second, we split the heirloom tomato.  Like the previous salad, it was well assembled and presented.  I could share more notes, but it went down so quickly!

We ended the savory dishes by sharing the culotte steak and pork coppa.  I was surprised just how well the blueberry paired with the pork and black garlic chips that came with the steak ensure each bite was excellent.  No worries about temperature as they were both cooked perfectly.

We ended the night with dessert, including a well place candle arranged by Nataly N.  Their olive oil cake was rather simple but nonetheless delicious.  The panna cotta was smooth and very easy to enjoy.

To round out my review, I can touch on service and atmosphere.  It was easy to say service was amazing.  Prompt coverage without interrupting our alone time.  Greeting smiles with great recommendations. On atmosphere, yes the dining area was very basic.  However, it was also very bright and filled with natural light as we dined just before sundown.  I feel it helped us be ourselves and feel comfortable while enjoying our fine dining we didn't need to lift a finger to prepare...","Text1: Amazing how construction changes everything.

0,"Methinks we just had a bad night, a really bad night.

The boyfriend and I went to Sage earlier this summer for a romantic little dinner for two. The patio was lovely. Weather was ideal. Not a mosquito in sight!

We ordered cocktails. I was in the mood for a dirty, Grey Goose martini. The boy had a mixed drink... probably gin and tonic. His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice. Who does that?

Appetizers and side salads were delicious.

Entrees come out. I have pasta with blue cheese. It's rich and I love it. Boyfriend cuts in to his medium-rare steak to find it cooked medium- well.  We share my pasta while waiting for the server to check up on us.

He never returns.

When we're done eating and drinks are empty, here resurfaces our lovely waiter. We tell him about the steak and he apologizes and takes it away. 

The rest of the story IS NOT A JOKE. This really happened.

A minute later the chef comes out to our table, with the steak in a cardboard box, and asks us if we'd like to take the steak home. We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare. It is at this point that he tell us that we are incorrect; the steak is medium-rare. Then he opens the box and shows us the steak, cut in half, grey in the middle. ""See, it's definitely  pink."" 

We say not a word. We couldn't. We were so dumbfounded. I suppose, since we're in our mid-20's, he thought he could pull a fast one. Or, maybe he thought we would believe him.... or maybe he was high on crack. I'm not sure. I will never forget this experience. EVER. Seriously, who does this guy think he's dealing with?

I'll go back someday, I suppose. But only if the chef is long gone. Or, if he writes me a formal letter apologizing for his shenanigans, which were all a terrible side effect of his medication that he is no longer taking.","5 star for their meats

3.5 star for their sides

Chicken: Wow the chef is from Southern so I definitely was expecting something like that. and it delivered. Chicken was great, juicy, crispy, flavored to perfection.

Turkey leg: Wow, I wanted to go pirate style and grab it and chow down. Great smoked flavor and skin, awesome taste in the actual turkey meat as well. Unfortunately I had to eat this with a fork and knife.

BBQ Pulled Pork / burnt ends (Wednesday Special): Solid, but not the best. Some burnt end parts were delicious, fatty, smokey, and soft. Some were very tough and couldn't eat. 

Sides: Personally, didn't like the sides that much. 

My favorite was definitely the mac n cheese. The other ones I got to try weren't that good, collared greens, green bean casserole and cornbread. (very dry and lacking flavor)","Text1: Methinks we just had a bad night, a really bad night.

I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice. Who does that?

Appetizers and side salads were delicious.

Entrees come out. I have pasta with blue cheese. It's rich and I love it. Boyfriend cuts in to his medium-rare steak to find it cooked medium- well.  We share my pasta while waiting for the server to check up on us.

He never returns.

When we're done eating and drinks are empty, here resurfaces our lovely waiter. We tell him about the steak and he apologizes and takes it away. 

The rest of the story IS NOT A JOKE. This really happened.

A minute later the chef comes out to our table, with the steak in a cardboard box, and asks us if we'd like to take the steak home. We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare. It is at this point that he tell us that we are incorrect; the steak is medium-rare. Then he opens the box and shows us the steak, cut in half, grey in the middle. ""See, it's definitely  pink."" 

We say not a word. We couldn't. We were so dumbfounded. I suppose, since we're in our mid-20's, he thought he could pull a fast one. Or, maybe he thought we would believe him.... or maybe he was high on crack. I'm not sure. I will never forget this experience. EVER. Seriously, who does this guy think he's dealing with?

I'll go back someday, I suppose. But only if the chef is long gone. Or, if he writes me a formal letter apologizing for his shenanigans, which were all a terrible side effect of his medication that he is no longer taking. 

 Text2: 5 star for their meats

3.5 star for their sides

Chicken: Wow the chef is from Southern so I definitely was expecting something like that. and it delivered. Chicken was great, juicy, crispy, flavored to perfection.

Turkey leg: Wow, I wanted to go pirate style and grab it and chow down. Great smoked flavor and skin, awesome taste in the actual turkey meat as well. Unfortunately I had to eat this with a fork and knife.

BBQ Pulled Pork / burnt ends (Wednesday Special): Solid, but not the best. Some burnt end parts were delicious, fatty, smokey, and soft. Some were very tough and couldn't eat. 

Sides: Personally, didn't like the sides that much. 

My favorite was definitely the mac n cheese. The other ones I got to try weren't that good, collared greens, green bean casserole and cornbread. (very dry and lacking flavor)",no

1,"Hope everybody had a nice Valentine's Day yesterday! I had a great dinner which lead right into our trip to San Francisco so I'll have to write about it later! In the mean time, just wanted to post up my visit to ROAST Coffeehouse on 104 St!

It took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.

Joe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!

For that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!

ROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school! Perfect place to study. What's your favorite coffee place?","#SomethingsHeatingUp. That's what Rostizado's social media's been taunting us with. This whole ""something's heating up"" at Mercer Building has gone long enough and now you can actually go gorge yourself on Tres Carnales' latest venture, a modern Latin-American rotisserie, focusing on local produce! Don't worry though, there's still #TacoForThePeople over a few blocks.

Firstly, I apologize for the lack of photos of the space. I just can't focus when there's an open kitchen and a full rotisserie of local Four Whistle Farm pork butts and chickens rotating in front of me! Seating is divided out into unique dining areas, some with long tables, a living room couch area, a sectioned off area for VIPs surrounded by a glass wall and where we were seated - the bar-style table in front of the kitchen. Just the way I like it. Who wouldn't want to be in front of all the action? Decor is an amazing mix of mid-century with old school televisions, books, and memorabilia; grand wall murals; outstanding woodwork. Cozy and welcoming! 

We started off with a couple of ""Entradas"" or appetizer dishes, all running at $16 but large enough to share with a group. Dani had given us the heads up that they only had two ceviche dishes left from last night's friends and family soft opening... so we pounced on that. If you don't like lime juice, then the cured Chilean sea bass might not be your cup of tea. You can tone down the lime juice with a bite of the orange slices and avocados and once in awhile you'll get a hit of the habanero chiles. For me, it was ah-maaaaazing. Really enjoyed all the different notes and textures! There's a reason why there was only two dishes left.

Cousin numero uno eyed the smoked salmon sopes, which conveniently came in threes! I'm not even the biggest fan of sopes, mostly because every time I've tried them, it's been a mushy corn flour mash with a slightly under-fried texture. Not these ones! Crisp exterior, light and airy inside full of flavor. The tequila cured smoked salmon and avocado cream spread were killer! I could probably order a few plates of these and just call it a night.

But what do you do when you want to try everything? You order platters. Rostizado has a platter for two with a combination of their rosti-pollo (chicken) and rosti-puerco (pork), served up with some rost-papa (potatoes) and tortillas for wrapping.

Platter for two is a slight exaggeration as none of us thought that we could finish it if there were only two of us. Then again we're three small Asian girls who already ordered appetizers. And wanted dessert. But we went all out anyways and went for it. Leftovers are your friend! 

The Rosti-Pollo is a dry rubbed chicken, roasted for an hour - an hour and a half, until crispy on the outside. Huge flavor on the skin, so much so that I wished rubs would penetrate more into the meat! So delicious though and in addition to the pasilla-tomatillo salsa, it can do some serious damage to you.

Alongside our platter, cousin numero dos also ordered the rosti-puerco cemitas, or sandwich. It's the same pork on the platter, slow roasted and sliced to order. The pork was my favorite, packing a whole whack of flavor, seasonings, and spices. There's even a fresh chimichurri, a green Argentinean sauce, to top it all off.

No, I lie. What topped it all off was the pulled cheese! It wasn't oozing or anything but it was an awesome addition to the cemita! Drippings and a fresh sesame baked bun made the sandwich a home run in my books and also the best value for your wallet at $16. Like the platter, it was also served up with some roasted potatoes with roasted cloves of garlic (sooooo good!).

Nothing could stop us (or me) from ordering the churros con dulce de leche. I can honestly say that these are the best churros I've had. Ever. Crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked and slightly chewy on the inside. Dipped into the dulce de leche, it was AMAZEBALLS. Dani believes it's because of the Mexican cinnamon that they use. Maybe it's the fact that I can see my order of churros being made in the back corner to order. Or maybe they're just magical and we'll leave it at that. SO GOOD.

So so so happy that Rostizado is open now. A great addition to Edmonton's dining scene, wonderful staff and service for opening night (it was packed!). You need to try it out. For those on a budget, highly recommend their cemitas (sandwiches) as their rotisserie can run a little high. But for a family-style meal, you have to get the rotisserie! Will definitely be back for the pork and to try out the rest of the appetizer menu (the Albondigas, a meatball dish, looked amazing!). Save room for the churros, thank me later. They don't take reservations, so you better head on down for dinner before people figure out they're open. Lunch service will be starting Wednesday, August 12 in addition to dinner service. You can even order take out and expect the meal in a few minutes. Something's heating up all right.","Text1: Hope everybody had a nice Valentine's Day yesterday!

1,"My recent visit to The Block, gives them an extra star. I'm happy to say, the CWE location is now on the same level as their sister location in Webster Groves. 

As those who follow my reviews, know I am a big fan of Fried Green Tomatoes. So when I saw them on the menu as an appetizer, I couldn't resist. Their green tomatoes were almost like a salad with the additional mixed greens and strips of bacon. The coating around the tomatoes was thick and crispy, but still giving you the great taste of fresh green tomato. If dining at lunch time, it could almost be a meal itself. 

My entree was the Pork Chop, which was thick, tender and juicy. It was served in a hot cast iron skillet with sautéed vegetables. I love the other white meat and The Block always serves it up well. 

I saved room for dessert, so I was excited to try their Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. It was a sweet treat.  If creme brûlée is on the menu, I order it and The Block, did it well. I'm always amazed at the crisp top on a brûlée and how creamy it is beneath. The vanilla flavor of this one, was strong which is fine with me, since vanilla is my favorite flavor.

A special touch that I like here at The Block is the way they serve salt & pepper. They don't use the typical shakers, they have small ramekins with tiny spoons. I've never had to use them, my food has always been seasoned well, but I like the unique presentation. 

I'll be returning soon to try their burger for lunch. Plus, I want more Brussels Sprouts, since I didn't enjoy an order this visit. 

When: June 25, 2006
Why: Dinner","Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics, it stated, ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. 

Not once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. 

The second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, ""no"".  I ate else where that day. 

What I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?

I understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. 

Disclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity.","Text1: My recent visit to The Block, gives them an extra star. I'm happy to say, the CWE location is now on the same level as their sister location in Webster Groves. 

As those who follow my reviews, know I am a big fan of Fried Green Tomatoes. So when I saw them on the menu as an appetizer, I couldn't resist. Their green tomatoes were almost like a salad with the additional mixed greens and strips of bacon. The coating around the tomatoes was thick and crispy, but still giving you the great taste of fresh green tomato. If dining at lunch time, it could almost be a meal itself. 

My entree was the Pork Chop, which was thick, tender and juicy. It was served in a hot cast iron skillet with sautéed vegetables. I love the other white meat and The Block always serves it up well. 

I saved room for dessert, so I was excited to try their Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. It was a sweet treat.  If creme brûlée is on the menu, I order it and The Block, did it well. I'm always amazed at the crisp top on a brûlée and how creamy it is beneath. The vanilla flavor of this one, was strong which is fine with me, since vanilla is my favorite flavor.

A special touch that I like here at The Block is the way they serve salt & pepper. They don't use the typical shakers, they have small ramekins with tiny spoons. I've never had to use them, my food has always been seasoned well, but I like the unique presentation. 

I'll be returning soon to try their burger for lunch. Plus, I want more Brussels Sprouts, since I didn't enjoy an order this visit. 

When: June 25, 2006
Why: Dinner 

 Text2: Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called ""One"". In the lyrics, it stated, ""One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do"". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. 

Not once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. 

The second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a ""limited menu"". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, ""no"".  I ate else where that day. 

What I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?

I bought some very cool buttons and some candy. I was also intrigued by the bottles of vintage soda pop. The owner makes candy bouquets as well, so if you want a delicious alternative to flowers for someone who loves candy, this is the place to go.","This is a drive-thru review.  Surprisingly, compared to the other reviews, I don't have a problem with this place.  Staff always seems to be super friendly.  Seriously.

0,"I came to Kanella for dinner after reading about it on yelp.  I was super excited to go because it seemed like a gem in the Philly byo scene.   Unfortunately, I thought it was very average.  The food was good, and the service was good but I didn't think it was a very memorable experience.  

There restaurant itself is very cute and the server was super friendly.  Our waiter was not particularly nice but not rude either.  As for the food, it was good.  I shared the warm hummus and the octopus with the table.  The hummus was very salty.  I wasn't impressed by the pita that came with the hummus, I was expecting more fluffy pita, but it was thin and a little limp (but it was warm!).  The octopus app was very nicely done, probably the highlight of the evening. The chopped vegetables accompanied the octopus very nicely.  The entrees were also good, but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the calamari dish, and my friends got the quail, lamb, and a white fish (I forget the exact one).  I tried a few bites of each.  Every dish was very nicely presented and tasted fresh and flavorful, but it didn't really blow me away.","The donuts are inventive and delicious.  I had a bacon maple donut on my birthday that made my day.  the koloches are amazing.  The lattes are always perfect and do not require any sugar.  There is so much more that District Donuts has to offer that I'll have to keep coming back to try other things on their menu.  However, thus far, I get to the counter and cave for donuts/kolaches every time.","Text1: I came to Kanella for dinner after reading about it on yelp.

0,"I haven't been here in a while, since they were dog friendly, they are not anymore. It annoys me a bit because most of the restaurants in Dunedin are. 

They have a nice size outside covered shaded patio. Come on Kelly's bring it back. Most pet owners are 200% responsible. (I really hate how the irresponsible pet owners kill it for the rest of us.)

This time around we came for my pre-birthday celebration. I was excited that they accepted reservations, and having a bigger group was done with ease. Make sure u do ask if the fan works. We got the section that did not. 

Since we were in the group section, it was super loud. It was everyone's birthday so it was super fitting.

Our waitress was pretty good considering how busy it was.  

For food, it was difficult for me to choose. I wanted a fish entree they had on special, it was gone. Many of what they had for options had tons of carbs, which I really wanted to lay off on. My hubby and a handful of the group had the espresso rubbed steak and loved it. Of course, my hubby always says get something diff. 

I'm not listening to him next time. I chose the beef tenderloin app and ahi tuna. I liked the ahi tuna better.

My birthday cake was a nice cherry on top that I split with the rest of the group.

I didn't get a drink this time around. I did try my friend's drink which was hella strong.

All in all, I'm blessed to have great friends that make my night perfect as can be.","Great Groupon deal & high hopes. 

My salad w ginger dressing was crisp
& fresh.  The dressing just fair. I've definitely had better.

The sushi was very good. We had the ""crazy dragon"" roll (or ""mad"" something!?) Please see the pix! 

Here's where we go downhill & the rating was killed. 

The chicken in my Yaki Udon almost tasted freezer burnt!  

Vince thought maybe a brine. 

Ruined my otherwise excellent dish.  I loved the actual Udon noodles & mushrooms & egg in the dish. 

Vince felt the same about the chicken in his moo shoo. 

I'd return but would NOT get that chicken again!!!!! (I took it for my dog!)","Text1: I haven't been here in a while, since they were dog friendly, they are not anymore. It annoys me a bit because most of the restaurants in Dunedin are.

I live about 2 miles from Five Guys and I rarely crave red meat, but when I do, I make an effort to have a burger...when Five Guys got to town, my hubby and I were very excited to give it a go.

We've tried it on SEVERAL occasions.  First of all, I know they make everything to order, but they are SLOW.  This is kind of annoying when I just want to grab and go...SECOND, it is underwhelmingly decent but not a fantastic burger.  

When a place SPECIALIZES in one thing, I think it should be done PERFECT, every time, no exception.  The one thing I do like about the burgers is the bacon.  They do the bacon AWESOME.  Everything else is just average, which is fairly disappointing considering it's ALL they do.

I also think it's ironic that they BOAST about how fabulous they are on every wall. Too bad none of those are local.  Maybe I'll check out a Five Guys in another city, but I would recommend Hardees over this joint and they are a LOT faster!","So much to do out doors here! You can see horses that are kept across the small street, play in the fun park, get wet in the new little water area, grill out, picnic, or sit by the Bay and look out over the water. There is also Fishing available to rent poles very cheap like $5 and they have bait! Plus there's a small local restaurant at the pier that has everything from seafood and cold drinks to yummy ice cream. This is a great place to walk with friends and family or exercise even. I love this small quiet place on the water.","Text1: I would definitely have to agree with Byron J. on this one (we seem to frequent many of the same locations)...

0,"I love Sephora, I really do. Like most women, this place is like catnip for me. But this is the smallest Sephora I have ever been to. Even the one near my mother (who lives in basically the middle of nowhere) is larger than this location. I had such high hopes, after all it took them so long to put a shop in Philadelphia. 

They also do not carry Bourjois or Anna Sui products anymore. Over all, disappointing but better than nothing.","As someone who is obsessed with my dog, I love stores like this. I actually wasn't planning on coming here, but I ran out of dog food while staying at my boyfriend's house for the weekend and this was the closest store that carried her specific food. This place is pretty big and is basically a department store for all your pet's needs. They have everything from food, treats, toys, health supplies etc for your dog or cat. They carry most of top high quality lines of pet food here, along with premade raw options as well. As soon as we came in, an employee came over that was super friendly came over and greeted my dog and I and asked if we needed help finding anything. I didn't need help finding anything as I already knew what was I looking for, but I like when stores do this. I can't tell you how many times I have been in other retail stores standing around clueless and can't even find anyone free to help. I was able to quickly find her food and also picked up a few cans of wet food while I was there. I was shocked by the price of her food! I had been paying $19 a bag at the store by my house in Philadelphia for the 5lb bag of my dog's food, which is a high quality, grain-free kibble. When they went to ring it up here, it was only $11.50! I could see a couple dollars difference, but that's a huge difference for the exact same food. I thought it may have been a mistake but I have returned to Buzzy's since and the food was still the same low price. The place in Philly must have been robbing me.I can't believe people have said this place is too expensive, high quality stuff is obviously going to have higher prices than cheap stuff. I find their prices to be very reasonable, reasonable enough that I will make the further drive over here from now on even though there are stores that sell her food closer to my house.

1,"Methinks we just had a bad night, a really bad night.

The boyfriend and I went to Sage earlier this summer for a romantic little dinner for two. The patio was lovely. Weather was ideal. Not a mosquito in sight!

We ordered cocktails. I was in the mood for a dirty, Grey Goose martini. The boy had a mixed drink... probably gin and tonic. His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice. Who does that?

Appetizers and side salads were delicious.

Entrees come out. I have pasta with blue cheese. It's rich and I love it. Boyfriend cuts in to his medium-rare steak to find it cooked medium- well.  We share my pasta while waiting for the server to check up on us.

He never returns.

When we're done eating and drinks are empty, here resurfaces our lovely waiter. We tell him about the steak and he apologizes and takes it away. 

The rest of the story IS NOT A JOKE. This really happened.

A minute later the chef comes out to our table, with the steak in a cardboard box, and asks us if we'd like to take the steak home. We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare.

Love her face for dealing with our drunken shenanigans!","Text1: Methinks we just had a bad night, a really bad night.

The boyfriend and I went to Sage earlier this summer for a romantic little dinner for two. The patio was lovely. Weather was ideal. Not a mosquito in sight!

We ordered cocktails. I was in the mood for a dirty, Grey Goose martini. The boy had a mixed drink... probably gin and tonic. His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice. Who does that?

Appetizers and side salads were delicious.

Entrees come out. I have pasta with blue cheese. It's rich and I love it. Boyfriend cuts in to his medium-rare steak to find it cooked medium- well.  We share my pasta while waiting for the server to check up on us.

He never returns.

When we're done eating and drinks are empty, here resurfaces our lovely waiter. We tell him about the steak and he apologizes and takes it away. 

The rest of the story IS NOT A JOKE. This really happened.

A minute later the chef comes out to our table, with the steak in a cardboard box, and asks us if we'd like to take the steak home. We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare. It is at this point that he tell us that we are incorrect; the steak is medium-rare. Then he opens the box and shows us the steak, cut in half, grey in the middle. ""See, it's definitely  pink.""

will definitely go back, havent yet tried the food.","preconcert stop for beer and dinner. solid beer selection, but minus one star because when my friend and i walked in, the hostess sat us at an open two-top table and then immediately another staffmember asked us to get up because the table was actually for other people. ummm, what? we ARE ordering food.  then they asked us not to order food at the bar because they would get us a table. actually, i'm not an idiot, and i know that means you (server) want the tip. thankfully, the bartenders were attentive and quick, so i was happily sipping something while we waited approx 15 mins for a different table.

still, major uncool points for the mistake.

serrano spread on the pork sandwich was delicious. but the sandwich was a lot larger than i pictured, and i couldnt finish it. didnt want to let a doggy bag cramp my style at the concert after, so the rest went to waste :(

overall, good. it would have been cool to comp something small for the trouble of having us sit down, and then again get up.

1,"I must say I was not impressed by this sushi restaurant. I have been waiting to hit a new spot so I could supply a whole new Yelp review, and this one is going to honestly be very negative.

First of all, let me just say that the interior of this establishment is very nice, the wall decorations and ceilings are decorated nicely, but once you get past that there is nothing good to say about Tsunami Sushi. A local supermaket, Publix, carries Tsunami sushi, and since it tastes so good at Publix, I assumed that the sushi would taste good at Tsunami sushi, and I was WRONG!

I had some eggrolls for an appetizer, which were decent, but nothing too special. You shouldn't bother paying the five dollars for them.

The sushi here was pretty bland, even my personal favorite the California, in freshness was not able to even remotely capture my taste buds at all. I tired some other rolls there like their Volcano Rolls and Philadelphia Rolls, but both were a disappointment and overall WASTE OF MONEY for the heavy price the restaurant charges.

My step-father, George Saunders, had their Korean Super Spicy dish and I must say that it was kickin'. I could smell it all the way from my side of the table, it left him feeling pretty sick the next day, but thats his own fault haha. 

Overall the bill was around $60, which wouldn't be bad if the sushi was great, but since it wasn't this place was a waste of time, and I would have been better off just going to Publix and buying the sushi from there! Big NO NO.","Cru Cellars is a great place to relax and enjoy some wine and cheese. It has been buzzing around town lately and made several wine bar lists for Tampa Bay. The dessert is also phenomenal - I definitely recommend the Creme Brulee - its airy and light and doesn't have an overbearing sugary taste normal recipes of it call for. My favorite wine is their dessert wine: Heinz Eifel Beerenausleseas. The inside of the bar is dimly lit and perfect for an outing with a friend or a date. Sometimes live music is available as well. 

The owner Jennifer is a certified sommelier and I have heard from friends that you can setup a consultation and have her help you find the perfect wine for you. She is active with engaging local bloggers and her pairings are spot-on in my book. 

Happy Hour on Tuesdays-Fridays from 4:30-6:30PM with $5 glasses and $5 small plates is certainly tempting to unwind to after a stressful day! There is also a decently sized parking lot in front of the business, which is hard to find in this area of town where parking is scarce with so many local hits nearby.

I can understand how it could bug people, and if the food wasn't so good, it would bug me.  Overall though, the crowd, noise, size, only add to the experience of being at a popular restaurant with good food.","My wife bought a car here.  I handled the negotiations.  

Our salesman was friendly and helpful.  Once the negotiations began however, our salesman left the picture and we were left to deal with the manager.  This experience was annoying.  I had done my research and shopped around.  The manager must not be accustomed to dealing with informed shoppers because he was obviously lying to me on a number of fronts.  Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.  

My advice would be that if you have to come here be armed with knowledge and info on pricing from other dealers but in general I would probably buy from a different dealer if I had to do it over.","Text1: Excellent italian food at good prices.

0,"Outliers gets a generous 3 star rating from me, but is a place I will continue to go back to when it is convenient to get a few beers. I have to judge them up against the ever growing list of breweries in Indy, and it just seems that they fall towards the back of the pack in most categories.  

Let's start with the beer. They almost always have their 4 house beers on tap. These include a brown, an IPA, a rye, and a pilsner. All of them are decent beers and worth getting, but none of them are head over heels better than what you can get at most places. Along with those 4 are usually a few taps of either a seasonal or some Brugge stuff. I have had some good sour/fruit beers from here, and I know they do some different barrel aging as well, so there are some interesting options every once in a while. The issue is that these extra beers, when they have them, are really slow to change and they haven't expanded their standard lineup in the year and a half they have been brewing. It seems in my experience that it is not uncommon to see the same tap offerings for well over a month, which leads to me not stopping in here as much as I would otherwise. They just don't hold a flame to the variety of styles and beers that the other breweries in Indy have, and their lineup gets boring quickly because of it.

The space is not much to get excited about either. It's an old warehouse with some picnic tables to sit at and some plastic tables in front of a tap trailer where you order your beer, but they have gone out of their way to keep the brewing and drinking areas separate, which is very disappointing. I love visiting breweries that have their brewery area prominently featured in their location, but you can't see much of any of their operation from the tables, which makes sitting in the old space even less justifiable when there are lots and lots of breweries in Indy that have a nicer setup and their whole operation is in view of the customers. They pretty much just have about the bare-minimum setup for people to stop in a try some beers, but it looks like more of an afterthought to me and isn't a place I would choose to go sit at for an afternoon.

The hours here recently got extended to be a little better than they were, so now you can drink here Friday from 4-8, Saturday from 2-5, or Sunday from 12-4. These hours make it obvious that they have a brewery that thrives on sales to restaurants much more than sales from their location. Service hasn't always been the best, and often it seems like the people working here are more what you would find at a brew fest where they are just volunteers helping the company out by pouring some beers. They are usually a little slow, don't know much about the beer, and I have on numerous occasions gotten served short pours because there is so much foam in my beer that they don't dump out or let settle. They are always nice though, and I assume it is hard to find someone who is a great customer service person who wants to work only a few hours on a Saturday afternoon or Friday evening.

I like that they are another local breweries that makes some good stuff, and their location close to my place is a big draw for me. It will continue to be a brewery that I stop at to get some decent beers at good prices, and maybe to try the occasional new offering, but it seems like they have been at a standstill for a while as far as what they have to offer so my visits keep getting more and more spread out. Hopefully things are working out for them though, and I will continue to keep an eye on their social media to seek out their new stuff when they have it.","I'm a big fan of TBar!  I mean really, how can you not like a place that offers 50+ different kinds of loose tea - and that's not even counting the speciality drinks, fizzes, or boba (pearls in the TBar lexicon)!  It was also nice to attend the Yelp Office Hours with Carrie and the gang last night, what a great idea to get to spend a few relaxing hours with some of Philly's finest!

What do I normally get when I go to TBar?  It really depends on the weather...  If it's warm outside, I prefer the Awake or Gin Fizz - these are herbal tea blends infused with fruit juice and mixed with sparkling water.  Very refreshing and tasty!  If it's cold outside, I prefer to get a loose tea blend like Midnight Blue or classic Oolong teas!

I love that there's something in every prices range, from cute coin purses, magnets and cards, to beautiful jewelry and local artisan made gifts that I eyed for myself. They also carry Hoosier Mama Bloody Mary & Margarita mixers, which I'd been looking all over for as a gift.

My ex got I think you touched your genitals' hand sanitizer (I loved it, but I'm not sure he was equally amused). 

Do yourself a favor and make a day of it in the Mass Ave. Arts district.  Be sure to allow plenty of time to take everything in at Silver in the City. I promise you won't leave empty handed.","If you're in the mood for something exciting and different, the Wild West shooting range is definitely worth checking out. It's located in Phase IV of West Ed, near the Fantasy Land Hotel. I'm not into guns and stuff, but this was something I always wanted to try just once.

I signed up for a single class through campus rec when I was attending the University of Alberta, and managed to get a student discount. I went with my boyfriend, and this was actually our first date. I recommend the range for other first-daters; it's a great way to break the ice, because you're both totally out of your element.

They round you up in a small group of people and go through the rules and basics with you. Once you're ready, ear-protectors and all, you get to try a range of their different firearms, from handguns to rifles. It also depends on how much you paid, and you get a certain amount of shots for each one. I don't remember the difference really, just that the rifle was super-heavy on my shoulder, and I felt like I was about to collapse under its weight!

You basically aim at these heavy-weight paper targets they post on the opposite wall. When I was there, the targets were aliens. I felt like Will Smith in Men in Black. The range officers stand behind you the whole time, to guide you if you need help. I think I made my instructor a bit nervous though, when I kept lowering my gun and unintentionally pointing it at his feet ... oops ...

Overall it's a great experience; the range offers a new kind of thrill if you've never tried this sort of thing before. I'm not sure I agree with their policies here however. They call themselves a family shooting centre, so basically they barely have any age restrictions. A young kid can try shooting a handgun if they want. I don't think that's such a hot idea.

 Text2: If you're in the mood for something exciting and different, the Wild West shooting range is definitely worth checking out. It's located in Phase IV of West Ed, near the Fantasy Land Hotel. I'm not into guns and stuff, but this was something I always wanted to try just once.

I signed up for a single class through campus rec when I was attending the University of Alberta, and managed to get a student discount. I went with my boyfriend, and this was actually our first date. I recommend the range for other first-daters; it's a great way to break the ice, because you're both totally out of your element.

They round you up in a small group of people and go through the rules and basics with you. Once you're ready, ear-protectors and all, you get to try a range of their different firearms, from handguns to rifles. It also depends on how much you paid, and you get a certain amount of shots for each one. I don't remember the difference really, just that the rifle was super-heavy on my shoulder, and I felt like I was about to collapse under its weight!

You basically aim at these heavy-weight paper targets they post on the opposite wall. When I was there, the targets were aliens. I felt like Will Smith in Men in Black. The range officers stand behind you the whole time, to guide you if you need help. I think I made my instructor a bit nervous though, when I kept lowering my gun and unintentionally pointing it at his feet ... oops ...

Overall it's a great experience; the range offers a new kind of thrill if you've never tried this sort of thing before. I'm not sure I agree with their policies here however. They call themselves a family shooting centre, so basically they barely have any age restrictions. A young kid can try shooting a handgun if they want. I don't think that's such a hot idea. It's a safe and controlled environment, but I think it should be one reserved strictly for responsible adults, not young children.",no

The perfect place to treat yourself or pick up some goodies for a party.","Ed's Rec Room is such as fun place. My friends and I come here to play bowling at least once a month. There are many lanes, but since the place gets extremely busy (naturally, more so on the weekends), reservations or coming as early as you can is strongly advised. As previous reviewers have already mentioned, Tuesday is the day of the week when you can bowl for cheap. Fridays and Saturday are so much more fun though, because the lights are turned off and bowling alleys glow. The atmosphere is amazing! In fact, cosmic bowling nights are so much fun, that it's easy to lose track of time, play for hours, and then be presented with the obscene check. It's important to keep an eye on the clock.
In addition to bowling alleys, Ed's has quite a few pool tables, arcade room, a nice lounge, and even the stage were many live venues take place.

0,First experience with these folks and I'm hooked.  Great service.  Very receptive and consultative.  Professional.  Great pricing.  I will be going back.,"I like La Va for its vintage, laid back atmosphere and tasty treats. Coffee prices are a little on the high end, but I am supposing this is more to cater to the newly gentrified surrounding areas than the regular South Street indie crowd. My husband can't get enough of the Dark Side of the Moon chocolate cake, but I personally am more into the coffee and atmosphere than the chocolaty treats.

LaVa sits at a location still close enough to the small businesses of the area but far away enough that it's not filled with tourists with loud children. I typically see lots of people doing work on their laptops, although I hear they boot you out after a certain amount of modem time, which in a way is both fair and messed up at the same time. 

In general, though, they have a decent selection of food and pasties to tide you over and they're only the second coffee shop I've been in that serves Turkish coffee. So needless to say I'm sold.","Text1: First experience with these folks and I'm hooked.  Great service.  Very receptive and consultative.  Professional.  Great pricing.  I will be going back.

I had the pretzel bites which were incredible they matched well with the cheese sauce.  

The server told me that the cheeseburger was voted best in St louis.  It was great.  It was overcooked.  I ordered medium rare, it came out med well.  Part of reason for four stars.  

They homemade chips were very good, but they would benefit from 20 sec in the microwave. 

It was expensive.  The bill for food alone was over $20.  Thus is the other reason for 4 stars.  Burger, chips, and a half a pretzel????

1,"I've been going here for dinner and drinks with friends on Monday nights for quite some time and it's definitely become my regular pub of choice, due in part to these friends who go here frequently. As a non-drinker (for the most part), I am mostly concerned with the food quality, which is excellent! I adore their food specials for special events such as holidays (the Canada Day specials were delicious for example in 2014, as was the St. Patrick's Day special). The soups are consistently unusual but good. The Monday night steak special with all you can eat sides is a consistent favorite for our group.

My friends really enjoy trying the great drinks from their 72 taps and other drink menu, and I happen to like having a blueberry tea here on occasion, though it's rare to see me drink alcohol. We love the service we get when we come here!

Don't forget to order a yummy dessert if you do eat here: the tapioca dessert is especially good as is the Bailey's Creme Brulee and the Chocolate lava cake.","While I've only been here once, my experience was a pleasure. Not only was the food prompt and delicious but I adored the bread with oil and vinegar and the servers checked with our table regularly to ensure that we were not in need of anything.

1,"I used to eat in at Bellacinos quite frequently. We always stuck with the pizza and it was pretty good.  After a hiatus I just got take-out recently - pizza, wings, and a grinder. The pizza was the greasiest pizza I've ever had. It was terrible. The box was soaked through and the crust had absorbed so much grease it was limp. And that's probably the last time I'll get pizza there.

The wings were ok. They offer hot, bbq, and teryaki (I think). They were very similar to Pizza Hut's wings. The grinder wasn't very good. It was the chicken, bacon, ranch and I could tell the chicken was the precooked, packaged stuff. Not like I expect them to make it fresh there, but still a turn-off.

My other problem is the restaurant always seems dirty. Even when there are hardly any customers in there, the tables are never wiped off and it just has a general dirty vibe. I think my Bellacino days are over.","This location is just a few steps from my office so it's my go-to spot for oil changes and getting taillights and headlights replaced (which seems to happen pretty frequently on my car). For those services I think they are pretty adequate. Pricing seems to be competitive and it's so convenient to just drop it off and pick it up at my leisure.

I also got new tires here and with that comes free rotations and balancing. They generally have some type of promotions running, so you can usually score some type of deal.

I don't think I'd go to them for any major auto repairs, though. One of my co-workers had a terrible time trying to get her car fixed. I'm sure some of the guys that work there really know their stuff, but the problem is you never know who's going to be working on your car or how qualified they really are. One of my oil changes was even messed up. A few days after I got it changed, my car was leaking oil and turns out they had stripped the cap or whatever and caused a leak. They were nice enough about fixing it, but I really wouldn't trust them to do anything more serious to my car.

If you plan on waiting for your service, make sure to bring a book. Even an oil change usually takes at least an hour.","Text1: I used to eat in at Bellacinos quite frequently.

1,"My first trip to Susanna Foo was at 6 months old when the restaurant was still a hole-in-the-wall takeout joint owned by Susanna's parents. My parents have been taking my brother and I ever since.

The food has always been reliable, but now that I am an adult, I find it lacking excitement. The service is always impeccable and I have never been disappointed by the overall decor or ambience.

There is plenty of wide open space and seating that doesn't make me feel like I'm in an underground bunker. The lines for Amtrak trains tend to be orderly because you aren't forced to snake around the 400 other passengers milling about or sitting smack in the middle of the floor.

There are plenty of options for a meal or a snack before your journey. The new Old Nelson Market serves up a good breakfast sandwich in addition to having the odd sundries that you might need on your way home via SEPTA.

I don't love the outdoor area - I always feel like it could be so much better, but then I remember that they frequently have food trucks and the like out there, so they can't really do much with it.  (and people smoke outside, I wish they didn't, but for you, maybe that's a good thing).  Also, if you're trying to be outside, that freight train can get pretty loud (but you can't even hear it from inside).  Bathrooms are much nicer than one would expect at a venue like this.

I will say please come early to get seating if you are in the standing section/area. However, the var is crazy. No real organization flow whatsoever. It took 38 minutes for us to get recognized because the bartenders were working wherever they got called. So definitely get your whistling and calling calls down pack for an alcoholic beverage from the bar. There's a TV that shows the stage but it is small. Seating is OK.","Although I have yet to sit in the Fox and Hound Tavern, I do love their food and drinks! How is that possible you may be thinking? Well, when it's 90-some-odd degrees out, you go lay out by the pool and the lovely bartender (I'm sure there is more than one but so far I have only had Sarah), comes out and takes your order! For a moment, it feels like I am on vacation. Then I look up and see the giant Amoco sign, and the feeling is long gone.  

I believe the Fox and Hound tavern looks the same as it did before, but the pool area got a makeover during the major Cheshire remodel and although it's a bit small, it is pretty darn cute. Really comfortable chairs, clean pool water, a nice pool floor design and of course yummy poolside food and drinks.

I normally don't order mixed drinks but on my first trip here it was a scorcher and beer just didn't sound refreshing. I ordered a mojito. And then 3 more. They are GOOD! Off their menu I have tried their pulled chicken sandwich and the fish sandwich. Both were scrumptious. However, if I had to pick a favorite it would probably be the pulled chicken sandwich. The barbecue sauce that comes on it is out of this world good! The french fries are damn good too!

I foresee myself spending many a hot afternoon here this summer, gulping down cold cocktails and working on my tan.",no

0,"Like Beawon a lot, been there a number of times, including for some large birthday dinners.

The bbq is great.  Recommend the short ribs and the spicy pork.  While I think the short ribs are good pretty much everywhere, Beawon's spicy pork is much better than some others.  The rice bowl (I can't remember if it was octopus or squid... though I think it was octopus) was delicious and my favorite of the rice bowls.  The tofu soup is pretty great too.  

I like spicy food, and I need to make sure to tell them that I want it extra spicy or else they tend to make to food pretty mild.  

There are buttons on the table to call your server, so the service is as quick as you want it to be.

BYOB","For the record, I did not get anything here. Just want readers to know they are good people.

There was a small, very cute dog that was tied up outside the salon. It is about 35 and windy right now and this dog was outside for at least a minute before my girlfriend and I spotted him. We went to see it, make sure it was warm. No coat, nothing but a choke chain to keep it warm. 

A very sweet dog she ended up being as we did what we could to comfort her. I stayed and kept her warm while my girlfriend went into the three local stores. A yarn shop, a coffee shop, and L'etoile. 

She couldn't ask everybody, but asked who she could. She went up to l'etoile and spoke to two of the stylists there. They went to each of their clients, one-by-one, asking if one of them had the dog. They allow dogs inside and on a cold day like this, definitely would be welcome. 

At least 10 minutes passes before my girlfriend comes down to check on the top with the stylists... they offer to take her in.

At this point, the dog has pissed herself from being so cold and is shivering her fur off. Literally shivering so hard some hairs were flying off. 

They offered to take her in and warm her up when finally the owner (A young 20-something hipster and her friend) comes out of the coffee shop staring at us, wondering why we are circling her dog. We explain to her that this is animal cruelty and she rebuffs it. That's all I'll say about the owner.

The stylists however, had their priorities straight. The dog stays warm and even if it is a stranger's, they will make sure it is warm.

In conclusion, these people are good people. I hope my girlfriend comes here and experiences the service that others have been consistently giving 4 and 5 stars","Text1: Like Beawon a lot, been there a number of times, including for some large birthday dinners.

For what this place offers and in a city as ethnically-challenged as Nashville, I really enjoyed what I was able to find.

Getting here was a bitch and a half for a pedestrian like me. I like that it's at a corner that is served by 2 bus lines. However, I had to walk up something akin to a freeway on-ramp to get here, since the little shopping center is on a sidewalk-less block of Charlotte, offset on a little hill.

The physical space was bigger than I expected. However, the amount of inventory wasn't as crammed into that space as I would expect from a world market.

The produce seemed sparse. I didn't see a sea of Asian greens. There was certainly more variety of produce than what I'd find at a Kroger's or Publix or Whole Foods.  But there are certainly other places in Nashville that would cater to specific ethnic groups that may have the produce you're looking for. When I come back, I will still look through the produce in the off chance that I find something that would inspire me.

The seafood section certainly had the space to cater to a lot more than what was offered. But I was there on a weekday afternoon, and the amount of customers present didn't warrant any stock turnover that indicated any freshness to me. I did appreciate that they had some live fish and crab and eel and crawdads. Yet I cried internally that Dungeness was nearly $20 a pound here.

I didn't look too closely at the meats. They had the offal (pork bung). I saw some lamb and goat and rabbits. And I could have asked if they had fresh pig's blood.

But as other Yelpers have noted, it's the non-perishable aisles that they're mainly here for.  I was beyond thrilled that I was able to find shrimp paste (bagoong), lechon sauce, banana ketchup, and even tamarind pulp candy (both the salty and sweet versions).

They have tons of varieties of noodles and instant noodles (I didn't notice if they had fresh noodles). Lots of bulk bags of rice and containers of soy sauce. Various grains, spices, candies, cookies, chips, etc.

Note: This is not a place you'd get customer service.

Bonus: No members of the ""Pink Mafia"" when I was here, thanks to Nashville's demo. The Pink Mafia are what I call the old, Chinese women who walk around with pink, plastic shopping bags and practically shove you out of the way and/or shout at you in Cantonese when they are buying produce. For an international market, the place hardly had anyone shopping there on a weekday. I'm sure the weekends might have more people.","Just had to add to the chorus about this location: It is not what I expected. This review is only about the experience I had being physically in this location to return equipment. My experience with them through their 800 number remains a mixed bag.

Based on the info you get online from people who've had horrible experiences returning their boxes, I was prepared for the worst. I took pics of the serial numbers before I went in. Because I was taken aback at how nice the place looked, I forgot to take a video of me handing over my equipment to the guy taking my info. He listened to what I was there for, then assigned me a number. 

I sat down on their comfy cushions; the entire room felt almost like a lounge. There were a few people ahead of me who had extended issues, so my wait time was longer than the other Yelpers. When it was my turn, I honestly expected to be told that they just lost the equipment I had turned in and that my fees would be in the thousands of dollars. Nope. If anything, they told me that Comcast owed me a refund. Cool bonus for me was that the guy handling my cancellation was also a fellow Bay Area transplant.

I was out of there in 30 minutes, stunned but hopeful that I will get my refund within the standard ""5-8 business weeks"" timeframe.

0,"I came back because my friend wanted to come here for lunch. I had the Train Wreck Po Boy, and she has a Fried Shrimp Po Boy Wrap. 

It was pretty good, in a ""cheesesteak from the pizza place down the street"" kind of way. It supposed to be, ""andouille sausage, steak, salami, onions, cheese, and creole mayo,"" but all you can taste in the steak and cheese with a little kick. The French baguette was pretty hard (inside and out), and I don't think they're fitting for a sandwich (unlike the *cough* rolls from that other place in RTM that are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside *cough*). I think I would've preferred a wrap.

She let me try one of the fried ""shrimp"" that fell out. The breading was very tasty, but the ""shrimp"" tasted similar to that of what you'd find in a grocery store ramen noodles with fake shrimp package.

We also witnessed the ""waitress"" mess up everyone's orders and then do nothing to make up for it.

I stand by what I said last time, the Alligator Sausage Po Boy they're ""famous"" for was oddly devoid of alligator sausage and was mostly peppers and onions.

There's a reason there were four seats open at 1pm on a Sunday, You can do better in RTM.","Holy moly, they definitely made the shwarma at this place better (compared to when it was Mama's Grill).  The seasoning was great!  I shared a shwarma platter with my friend and it was enough for both of us to not feel like a bowling ball ready to be rolled over.  And I'm pretty sure the pitas were served at room temperature before which would annoy me to no end (I'm Indian, I like my naan and pitas warmed up!)  But now, they are nice and warm :)

Since my best friend keeps kosher, I'm pretty sure this won't be my last time coming here.  Please don't disappoint me, Chickpeas!!","Text1: I came back because my friend wanted to come here for lunch. I had the Train Wreck Po Boy, and she has a Fried Shrimp Po Boy Wrap.

0,this is your standard chain massage place. the workers are hit or miss and the atmosphere is pretty sterile which i guess you want in a massage studio to a degree. As i said its hit or miss,"I've been waiting over $200 with limited assistance and little interaction. While they have a decent range of affordable mattresses, the staff seems quite slow and unavailable if they have more than one customer. God forbid they get more than one customer, you are guaranteed at least a thirty minute wait. Not to mention, the staff didn't even lift a finger to help.

[Update:] The service you do receive is really kind and personal. The attendant will go above and beyond to make sure you get the mattress you like at the price on the tag with a decent delivery service.

0,"I've been dying to try Federal Donuts since they first opened their flagship location. So a few weekends back when we happened to be in the neighborhood, we finally had our chance! 

We walked into the small storefront and were greeted by a warm smile behind the counter. We settled on a half order of the buttermilk ranch chicken and six chili garlic style wings (which we were told were excellent choices btw.) The lovely lady behind the counter told us she'd cut us a break and just charge us for the whole chicken instead of two halves to save a buck. 

Then of course, we needed to decide on donuts. Lots of their specialty donuts were sold-out so we stuck with the classics. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and Bry went with the Apollonia Spice, then as if our day couldn't get any better, the sweet lady behind the counter told us she would throw in the Vanilla Lavendar for free, just so we could try it! Bam! They just earned themselves a lifelong customer. The inside of the store is minimalist and charming, there are about six seats at the counter so if there is an open spot, snatch it up quick!

The buttermilk ranch was my absolute favorite. I loved the flavor and crispiness of the outside and the chicken was crazy moist on the inside. I've had dreams about it every night since I first got my hands on it. 

Please note: and we were newbies so we had no idea, with every order of chicken you get a tasty honey lemon donut to go along (pictured below.) It's really the perfect compliment to the chicken -- a little savory and a little sweet. If I had known that we might not have ordered three other donuts, but heck, you live and you learn.","I have been going here for many months now. I do the mama and baby fitness class. It's a great full body workout and you can have your baby either sit with you, carried them in a carrier, or have them chill out in the car seat or the can walk around. It's a small gym with a chilled out atmosphere and limited parking. There is street parking but I would give yourself some extra minutes to find a spot.

0,"This place is amazing. 

The Yelp app came to the rescue again last night when we needed something sweet after dinner. We'd never heard of Glazee, but it came up as being close to where we were and with amazing reviews so we tried it out. 

The owner was quick to tell us that he had no employees and ran the business himself.  He makes all the ice cream himself fresh in the back.   We talked to him for a good amount of time while we stood around and sampled a few flavors - he is one interesting dude. A Harvard grad with a background in politics and engineering who  makes ice cream... I think we could have talked to him all night if other people hadn't come in needing to be helped (since he's the only employee).

I tried the cinnamon cream cheese, the chocolate cupcake and the chocolate.  It may have been the hardest decision of my life, but I went with the chocolate cupcake. Delicious.  

The portions are generous.  I got a medium cup and couldn't finish it all. 

The only minor issue was that his credit card machine wasn't working.  He uses his ipad with the little swiper attachment and it wasn't running properly. Luckily I had cash, but he told us that if we didn't it was no problem to come back and pay him next time.","Baum's is an old-fashioned dancer's shop in the heart of Center City which has been around for a million pirouettes. 

From classical leotards, tights, pointe shoes and tutus to modern exercise wear, Baum's has everything you need to get ready for dance class or a performance.  

They sell costumes (including a big discount rack) for children and adults, and you can order wholesale-quantity of costumes through them if you need to outfit your class for a recital.  Pick up sequins, fringes and trims by the yard; or top hats and canes to accessorize your dancers (or your Halloween costume). 

Many items need to be pulled from stock by the staff, but they are very kind and helpful.  Prices are reasonable for good-quality dancewear and shoes.

1,"This review is based on their lunch special sushi deal. While is IS a great 'deal', as the old adage says: you get what you pay for.  Three rolls plus soup or salad for $12.00, sounds good right? Well it is except they skimp on the fish and the rolls are on the small side. The sushi is still tasty, which keeps me coming back, but sometimes I wonder just how much of a 'deal' I'm getting.  I have ordered take out from here numerous times because I like the deal and in a crunch sushi craving, it fits the bill. 

However, they aren't consistent.  Sometimes the rolls are prepared perfectly with enough fish to not make you question why you ordered from here, and other times, my roll is falling apart and I'm wondering how my Alaskan roll found its way to me sans salmon. Did I order a veggie roll? No. Just have to ""Where's Waldo"" your salmon sometimes? Gotcha. Lastly, delivery has taken upwards of an hour sometimes during lunch rushes. Make sure you eat a granola bar before you order.

I won't two star them because the fish is still fresh and is satisfying, but had to three star because there are so many sushi spots in the area that deserve the 4 and 5 star spots.","Update time and another star added.

Hung out here for several hours and I only ordered one drink I didn't care for (my bad, I was trying to be adventurous).  Other than that- each drink was flawless and we were both impressed.

Had to add that. I dream about it weekly.","Sapore sits in the old location of Wholly Mackerel.  They have been open for about 6 months.  On a whim my wife and I stopped by for supper on Saturday.  We were darn lucky to get a table for two.  By 7:15 all the tables were taken and these people had reservations.  This is not a simple little Italian restaurant.  It has a menu that is only a left side and a right side and maybe 3 specials that the wait staff will inform you just as they come up to take your order.  So my pasta dish that I was going to order changed to a veal chop Saltimbocca.  The chop was cooked to perfection and the prosciutto and mozzarella on top was very tasty;  My wife had a chicken dish that was fried and battered served with copious amounts of garlic the name was Siciliano it would be your choice of veal or chicken.  My wife ordered a pasta side dish instead of the vegetables.  One word fantastic.  We did not have a salad but we ordered the anti pasta plate it has a unique name of Salaumi.  It came with mozzarella, salami, mortadella,  prosciutto and a pickled relish of cauliflower carrots and peppers.  Very nice.  The only down side to me was the portions were on the small side.  $32.00 for the veal special seemed to me a lot of money for the small amount of veal and vegetables.

 Text2: Sapore sits in the old location of Wholly Mackerel.  They have been open for about 6 months.  On a whim my wife and I stopped by for supper on Saturday.  We were darn lucky to get a table for two.  By 7:15 all the tables were taken and these people had reservations.  This is not a simple little Italian restaurant.  It has a menu that is only a left side and a right side and maybe 3 specials that the wait staff will inform you just as they come up to take your order.  So my pasta dish that I was going to order changed to a veal chop Saltimbocca.  The chop was cooked to perfection and the prosciutto and mozzarella on top was very tasty;  My wife had a chicken dish that was fried and battered served with copious amounts of garlic the name was Siciliano it would be your choice of veal or chicken.  My wife ordered a pasta side dish instead of the vegetables.  One word fantastic.  We did not have a salad but we ordered the anti pasta plate it has a unique name of Salaumi.  It came with mozzarella, salami, mortadella,  prosciutto and a pickled relish of cauliflower carrots and peppers.  Very nice.  The only down side to me was the portions were on the small side.  $32.00 for the veal special seemed to me a lot of money for the small amount of veal and vegetables.

0,"O' My Buns is new franchise that opened up near the Food Court in Park Place Mall.  They give away free samples, and their store reminded me of those little Korean bakeries you find in some cities.  Their flyers on the mall entrance doors states that these are fresh buns.  It is not like they are reinventing Cinnabons, but these are just pastry sweet breads rolled out with different flavors.  They are a good combination with coffees and teas.  There are plenty of coffee drinks at O' My Buns, and the buns have hints of tiramisu-tasting powder in them.  They are fairly sweet and spongy.  I think they were $1.75 each.","Been wanting to come here for a while! Came across this place on Yelp and noticed it had some good reviews! The first thing that caught my attention was the elote which is a roasted corn on the cob with chile powder, cheese, and queso.. we visited for the first time today! It was very busy which was a good sign that we came to the right place! It was a bit hot inside the place with little to no air conditioning, and we waited for our food for about 15 minutes. Our tacos were very good and had lots of flavor but not sure if they were exactly worth almost $4 each, the corn was not my favorite it has too much flavoring going on. But overall we enjoyed our experience here and the girl taking orders was very friendly and remembered my name on the way out to ask how our food was. We will be back in the future.","Text1: O' My Buns is new franchise that opened up near the Food Court in Park Place Mall.

It is a great place to bring out of town visitors.  The eight mile loop is an amazing drive (or bike ride, or run depending on how brave you are).  In addition, there are a ton of trails.  You can get out and see everything.  

Do stop at the visitors center if you get a chance.  They are very helpful and there is a ton of information in their which always great for those new to the desert.  They have all the trail maps and you can buy a pass if you are so inclined.

Take plenty of water, and some snacks or a lunch and enjoy everything the landscape has to offer.

Be very careful of cyclists/runners when driving.  You shouldn't be in a hurry anyway as you should be enjoying the scenery.

I highly recommend this place to everyone!",Food is really good here - my favorites are the Evil Jungle Princess and the Drunken Noodles! Service is also very good. Definitely a good Thai place to have in the suburbs!,"Text1: I love this park!

The service was great, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty of it.  We had the barbecued ribs and chicken, baked beans, mac and cheese, potato salad and green salad.

We stopped in for a (very ample) tasting a few months ago and that went very well too, which is why we decided to have them cater our event.

It took me a long time to make my way down to ROAST but I finally did it. As much as I love the atmosphere of Transcend (may you return to downtown one day) and Credo, I think I like ROAST the best! Something about the wooden interior, the expansive seating areas and trendy wallpaper makes it a place where I'd want to sit and relax.

Joe and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty bustling from what would have expected. Another plus: their menu is extensive, serving up specialty drinks as well (Credo, please expand, I can't drink straight coffee!). ROAST also serves food and wine after 4pm, which makes me want to return ASAP!

For that day though, we were happy with our drinks. Joe and his regular latte, decorated with their signature 'R' (to go, because he just had a cup of coffee with breakfast), and a dark chocolate mocha for me. This is the first time I've ever had a mocha where I didn't find was too bitter (aside from anything served at Starbucks, pure cream and sugar). Absolutely loved my drink!

ROAST Coffeehouse, thus far, is my favorite out of all coffee hangouts. Runner-up: Wild Earth Bakery. I only wished I discovered these places when I was in school! Perfect place to study. What's your favorite coffee place?","Appetizers were 5.00 so we tried the tater tot nachos ( seems to be the new thing) tasty but not hot, not cold but not very good. IMHO I ordered the tri tip and sweet corn salad with grilled veg and chimmicurri  sauce and the spicy sauce. Vegetables were vey good. Meat though was less than exciting ( name of the place is Rotisserie) and chewy. Husbands hamburger was small and not a fresh made patty. I guess I expected more. Tacos seemed popular, but I don't think I'll try again. Building remodel was beautiful!

Just want readers to know they are good people.

There was a small, very cute dog that was tied up outside the salon. It is about 35 and windy right now and this dog was outside for at least a minute before my girlfriend and I spotted him. We went to see it, make sure it was warm. No coat, nothing but a choke chain to keep it warm. 

A very sweet dog she ended up being as we did what we could to comfort her. I stayed and kept her warm while my girlfriend went into the three local stores. A yarn shop, a coffee shop, and L'etoile. 

She couldn't ask everybody, but asked who she could. She went up to l'etoile and spoke to two of the stylists there. They went to each of their clients, one-by-one, asking if one of them had the dog. They allow dogs inside and on a cold day like this, definitely would be welcome. 

At least 10 minutes passes before my girlfriend comes down to check on the top with the stylists... they offer to take her in.

At this point, the dog has pissed herself from being so cold and is shivering her fur off. Literally shivering so hard some hairs were flying off. 

They offered to take her in and warm her up when finally the owner (A young 20-something hipster and her friend) comes out of the coffee shop staring at us, wondering why we are circling her dog. We explain to her that this is animal cruelty and she rebuffs it. That's all I'll say about the owner.

The stylists however, had their priorities straight. The dog stays warm and even if it is a stranger's, they will make sure it is warm.

In conclusion, these people are good people.

It's almost an obligation that every pizza place have some sort of ""premium cheese fries"" ...usually that means cheddar, mozzarella, swiss, bacon, and ranch/ceasar dressing give or take. Everybody has something like this with their own name attached... mega fries, super fries, ultimate fries, and in the case of Allegro... Allegro House Fries. 

Wow... in all my years Allegro is the only place that is SERIOUS about bacon. I really couldn't believe it. It's really cool that they got this right because I guess given the area... its ""college food"" and the only other guys who come anywhere close also had ""college food"" only Temple's campus. I've been out of Temple for years now so that other place is just a memory, but Allegro is here and now... and still in my neck of the woods.

1,"Bowl & Roll is one of the better spots in the Nashville Farmers Market! They make rice bowls and rolls. A number of toppings are available including veggies, kimchi, and bulgogi. They're popular, so there's occasionally a line (esp. at lunchtime on Friday), but it is one of the better places in the market.","Burger Up is a modern, hipster burger spot on 12 South. Good food, good drinks, good beer. 

The good? They offer a pretty good variety of burgers - from your simple burger to burgers with high end ingredients and interesting combos. They also offer patty melts, turkey burgers, bison burgers, salmon burgers, and vegan patty burgers. Our group of eight tried a variety of the burgers (and one salad), and there was something for everyone! They also offer some great cocktails and beers on tap (although they were out of several of the beers listed). The service was great, and the decor and ambiance is a perfect blend of modern hipster and classic burger joint. 

The less good? They don't take reservations, and they won't seat incomplete parties, so if you have a big group, Burger Up is simply not a good option. It can get quite crowded (it's in a small space) - we ate at 6 on the dot on a weekday and it was packed.

This time, they didn't charge me for the BURNT PITA CHIPS but gave them to me - over half of which were not even edible compared to the previous trips where I had to ask for them or leave empty handed because they claimed that I paid $1 for 3 extra chips.

Food - The Friday Pasta special is my usual dish. Good blend of lettuce as a salad base with penne. The balsamic sauce was on the side which was great for me. Finally, this past Sunday it was served HOT, not stone cold. In fact, after 30 min of running errands, it was still warm when I got home so it must've been hot.

Hostess: Quoted us a wait time of 20 min but our wait was less than 10. Did she make a honest mistake in her estimate or do they intentionally inflate wait times to discourage people from waiting?

Had the sausage skillet. While it was a filling meal, there was nothing to excite me. It felt like a regular entree that you could get at any breakfast joint.

Sitting next to the window, there was a huge breeze around my ankles that it was almost uncomfortable to sit correctly in the booth.

A lot of people go to Remedy for the chai.  If you are a big chai fan, you need to check out Remedy because it is their claim to fame.  Delicious!

We were greeted by friendly front of house staff and seated promptly.  Our table was a bit out in the open, but otherwise was situated nicely not too close to neighboring tables.  Our waitress, Nicole, was quick to take our drink and app order.  She was very friendly and really knew the food and beer menus.  She thoroughly answered our questions and was on point with the answers as well.

We decided on the Beer Queso Nachos.  They are served with nachos and the beer queso separate.  You can just slather on the whole queso mix or dip chip by chip.  We chose to dip the chips.  The queso was brilliant.  Great flavor and ingredients.  The only recommendation on this would be to reduce it for a bit longer to make it thicker and less runny.  Other than that, it was perfect.

For beers my fiance had the Reincarnated as a Cloud IPA.  I had the Shambolic.  I'm not an IPA fan, but I enjoyed a couple sips of the Reincarnated as a Cloud.  The Shambolic was precisely what I wanted: A smooth beer with a citrus note and a good sour kick.  We loved our 8 oz. pours so much that we decided to bring home 64 oz growlers as well.

Dinner-wise I chose the burger, medium.  It was cooked as requested and the bacon ... oh the bacon!  What a beautiful, crisp piece of pork.  Some of the better bacon I've had, though Harry's Blue Bell Taproom is still tops for bacon in my book.  The mustard and accoutrements blended perfectly.  The included fries were crisp and tasty.  My fiance had the Veggie Burger with all the fixings from the regular burger.  She loved it and it was definitely tops in her book of veggie burgers.

Overall we were both satisfied with our choices of beer & food.  I do think if they added some booths by the windows and near the brewing area it would add a lot to the space!

1,"I REALLY enjoyed the Thai Orchid. I wasn't expecting to find Thai this good in a strip mall, but my, was I surprised. They were pretty busy when we got there, but we had reservations so we rolled right in and got a table immediately (sweet!). 

I was really taken aback by how nice the hostess and the waitress were. They were genuinely very friendly and even laughed convincingly at my usual offering of lame jokes. 

The restaurant is a BYO and we brought a bottle of wine, which they promptly uncorked and put on ice. 

Their menu has a heat/spiciness scale that goes up to 4 peppers. I got the drunken noodles (marked as 3 peppers) and asked if they could make them ""at least a 4."" They were happy to oblige and I found the heat level to be perfect. The spring rolls were also very good. 

Overall, I was extremely happy with our experience at Thai Orchid and will definitely go back. Highly recommended.","I had preemptively tempered my expectations before visiting City Kitchen: newish Italian restaurant in a sleepy strip mall in the suburbs; I would be OK with OK. But I was pleasantly and extraordinarily surprised by my experience here. 

The place has a really cool, modern, urban feel to it. It was packed when we got there, but we were seated fairly promptly at an awesomely-furnished table -- huge, overstuffed chair; distressed wood table; etc. I also liked that they put a jug of water on the table (one of those sweet flip-top jugs). It's a BYOB, so we brought some wine from the liquor store across the street, and they quickly uncorked it and put it on ice.

For me, the standout of the evening was the pasta. They have a ""build-your-own"" pasta option, which was really spectacular. You get to choose the type of pasta, the sauce, and a couple of ingredients to mix into the sauce. The ingredients range from artichokes through sausage through cheeses. I got a huge bowl for something like $12, and it was absolutely delicious.

All in all, we had a great experience, and I will definitely be returning.","Text1: I REALLY enjoyed the Thai Orchid. I wasn't expecting to find Thai this good in a strip mall, but my, was I surprised. They were pretty busy when we got there, but we had reservations so we rolled right in and got a table immediately (sweet!). 

I was really taken aback by how nice the hostess and the waitress were. They were genuinely very friendly and even laughed convincingly at my usual offering of lame jokes. 

The restaurant is a BYO and we brought a bottle of wine, which they promptly uncorked and put on ice. 

Their menu has a heat/spiciness scale that goes up to 4 peppers. I got the drunken noodles (marked as 3 peppers) and asked if they could make them ""at least a 4."" They were happy to oblige and I found the heat level to be perfect. The spring rolls were also very good. 

Overall, I was extremely happy with our experience at Thai Orchid and will definitely go back. Highly recommended. 

 Text2: I had preemptively tempered my expectations before visiting City Kitchen: newish Italian restaurant in a sleepy strip mall in the suburbs; I would be OK with OK. But I was pleasantly and extraordinarily surprised by my experience here. 

The place has a really cool, modern, urban feel to it. It was packed when we got there, but we were seated fairly promptly at an awesomely-furnished table -- huge, overstuffed chair; distressed wood table; etc. I also liked that they put a jug of water on the table (one of those sweet flip-top jugs). It's a BYOB, so we brought some wine from the liquor store across the street, and they quickly uncorked it and put it on ice.

For me, the standout of the evening was the pasta. They have a ""build-your-own"" pasta option, which was really spectacular. You get to choose the type of pasta, the sauce, and a couple of ingredients to mix into the sauce. The ingredients range from artichokes through sausage through cheeses. I got a huge bowl for something like $12, and it was absolutely delicious.

0,"I really like this place! Not only do they serve sandwiches and things like that, but they have a full sushi bar, too.

When you are in this restaurant you really feel like you are in another world. I guess part of that is because it's in a hotel. This place is super ""trendy"" with fancy big screens and a ""modern"" kind of layout.

For my meal I decided that I wanted a Philly roll for my appetizer and a pressed burger for my meal. Weird, huh? Well, unfortunately the roll and the burger ended up coming out together, so I basically had a hamburger with sushi on the side. No biggie. The burger was okay, but not overly great. The sushi roll was super fresh and tasty.

If I go back, I'm sticking with the sushi.","great variety on the happy hour tapas -- fried oysters, stuffed mushrooms, grilled garlic, chicken wings veal and pork meatballs. great value but salty on the first visit. even saltier on the second.

from the regular menu -- the mussels ($9 for a small bowl) smelled like toilet. yes we know the smell of fresh mussels. the manager was assuring us that that's how they are supposed to taste. I doubt she smelled them as nothing that smells like feces and urine should go in one's mouth.

the ceviche style mixed sea food -- popcorn previously frozen shrimp and rubber band calamari was boiled, tasteless and meager ($9 for a tea saucer).

the bar tender was misinformed (she said that the sea food was supposed to be raw) and rushed.

not a penny again.","Text1: I really like this place! Not only do they serve sandwiches and things like that, but they have a full sushi bar, too.

0,"I have given good reviews to Maher in the past, and generally have had good experiences. However, they always gave out free rental vehicles while getting and oil change and this perk was one of the reasons I held such a high opinion of Maher Chevrolet. I learned a couple mornings ago, that is no longer the case. Without that perk, I am seriously disappointed, but I realize this was a rather rare perk for a Chevy Dealership. 

While I have had a few frustrating moments here, who is lucky enough to deal with a car dealership, or service department without a little frustration? Generally, I have very good experiences and have been a loyal customer of the service department since 2009 (when I moved to Florida). I also leased my 2014 Cruze here last year. While I do not think I got the best deal in the world, I will assign that blame to the sales man doing a good job and my lack of patience with bargaining when it is only a lease and I will be giving it back. 

So my most recent experience was a little less than stellar. I tried booking an appointment online instead of over the phone. I had some notes in the bottom notes section advising of my need for a rental car and stressing that I would need to reschedule my appointment if there was no rental. My notes about the rental car went unnoticed and so when I arrived, after sitting around for 15 minutes as phone calls were made during my blocked off appointment time, I learned of the policy change and I had to cancel my appointment and I was still late to work. 

I was not a happy camper and emailed a complaint through their website. I waited a maybe 30 minutes and after getting no response decided I would post my complaint here. I did and Maher Chevrolet quickly reached out to me. After a little bit of phone tag, I spoke with the manager. He was very apologetic and I was very appreciative. Obviously they cannot change a policy just for me, and I did not expect them to. I will be happy just knowing that they will review the notes section in more detail in the future and promptly advise when requests cannot be met. Even if they cannot call you, the moment you arrive for you appointment, someone working in the service department should quickly advise you that your request cannot be met, so you do not waste time sitting around only to learn you cannot be helped. As a side note, the dealership should contact the 3rd party that makes the maintenance software to get changes. Either (1) remove the notes section completely, because there are no flags to catch the service advisers attention, the notes section is at the very bottom and easy to miss; or (2) ADD SOME KIND OF FLAG. Obviously I prefer adding some sort of flag, but if that is too problematic, then just remove the notes all. If I were unable to leave notes, then I would be forced to call and there would be a higher likelihood it does not fall under the radar.

Still, Maher has great customer service with a friendly attitude. The dealership is a clean and updated. Despite the fact that my parents hope to retire from GM soon, they will be moving down here and will remain loyal to GM even if I may not. I am sure once they get down here from Detroit, they will bring their new Equinox in for service. I am seriously impressed with the quality of my Cruze LS compared to my prior Chevy Aveo.","To sum it up: pictures look better than it really is. 

These ""sushirritos"" are just bigger uncut versions of actual sushi rolls. Literally, it's just seaweed, filled with the same rice, veggies, sauce, and meat as you would put in a roll (your choice), and wrapped in paper instead of cut up into small pieces. Yes, it looks really good, but you will spend $10 to still be hungry. I am a small female who doesn't eat large portions, but I could've eaten 2 in one sitting (but of course, I can't afford such luxury).","Text1: I have given good reviews to Maher in the past, and generally have had good experiences.

1,"Like Beawon a lot, been there a number of times, including for some large birthday dinners.

The bbq is great.  Recommend the short ribs and the spicy pork.  While I think the short ribs are good pretty much everywhere, Beawon's spicy pork is much better than some others.  The rice bowl (I can't remember if it was octopus or squid... though I think it was octopus) was delicious and my favorite of the rice bowls.  The tofu soup is pretty great too.  

I like spicy food, and I need to make sure to tell them that I want it extra spicy or else they tend to make to food pretty mild.  

There are buttons on the table to call your server, so the service is as quick as you want it to be.

BYOB","I had to revise my review with the new owners, and I think it is a step down (dropped one star).  The kimchee jigae (spicy tofu stew) was pretty similar, though there were noodles in it now.  The jaeyook kimchi bokum (stir fry with spicy pork and kimchi) was ok, but I was disappointed that they put this gigantic block of tofu under the meat, making it look like the plate was piled high when the portion was nowhere near as large as it used to be.  My favorite dish, the octopus rice bowl, is what has gone down hill the most.  

This place is ok now, used to be much better.  Service is still very good, but with the changes in the food I imagine that I will be spending more time at Sammy Chon's KTown BBQ (Korean BBQ just a couple miles down rt. 70).

0,"Let's get one thing out of the way at the beginning.  I know next to nothing about Arnold Myint.  I mean I am aware that he is a hometown kid gone big time on TV, but that is about the extent of it.  I have never seen top cook or been to any of his other restaurants.  Heck he might have been the person who prepared my food during my visit to am@fm.  He kind of looked like the guy on the poster, but that is a glamour shot so who knows.  All of this is to say that I had no preconceived notions of what am@fm would be or what to expect.  

I went during the farmers market lunch rush and sat at the counter instead of going the carry-out  route.  The counter space and the additional seating are both a significant step up from the normal farmers market environment.  Real silverware, clothe napkins, wine glasses for water, you get the picture.  

I ordered the counter special which was a crostini plate with four different types of crostini.  This was not a pre-prepared dish, it was acually made to order by maybe-Arnold-Myint on the spot.  While it was being prepared I was given a small bowl of the house made potato chips which were excellent.  The crostini arrived and between the four of them they offered what almost amounted to a full course meal.  There was the heirloom tomato and basil crostini (salad), the artichoke goat cheese crostini (app), the dill egg salad crostini (main), and the ricotta peach and honey crostini (dessert).  They were all excellent and actually filled me up far more than I expected going in.  To top it off I got a small slice of brownie and some blueberries as a bonus.  All in all it was a completely satisfying meal and a complete surprise in the farmers market.  

For all of this I paid a whopping $8, a fantastic deal and what you would pay for a combo set at almost any other restaurant for lunch. 
I don't know if the counter special will be a daily feature or if I just lucked out on the day I went.  The sandwiches and salads also offered a lot of variety and were very reasonably priced.  You could get a half sandwich (3.75) and a side salad (2.25) for 6 bucks and have a pretty awesome light lunch.   I also saw a couple of customers who just went with a sampling of 3 salads and they seemed to be very pleased.  

So value + quality + nice setting = a very satisfied customer  

Overall, I think that am@fm is an outstanding addition to the farmers market and to Nashville dining as a whole.  They have fresh creative food at very reasonable prices.  I know that I am already planning multiple visits back to see what else they will offer.  

I went to am@fm with a clean slate, I left nothing but a clean plate.","This place is legit! The portions are good for the price, the service is friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly. The space is small, so there is often a waiting list, but it's worth the wait. I do wish there were more vegetable dishes on the menu.

1,"My 1st review of 2018!  I stayed one night here NYE 2017 into 2018.  This hotel is a block and 1/2 from Scottrade and I was attending a NYE Comedy Show, so perfect proximity.  The hotel also has direct access to Landry's and Hard Rock Cafe right outside the rear entrance.  Valet and Check-in went very smoothly and the room itself was very clean and nice.  The hotel does have a twist and turn maze-like layout so you need to pay close attention to the directional signs.  The bed was pretty comfortable and the pillows are nice.

I didn't send it back though...  Also, didn't get my toast.  haha, probably didn't need the carbs anyway.  So, I'd suggest double checking your order.

I did bring this to the hotel staff attention as I checked out and they promptly compensated me for the trouble which was great.

I'm not a veggie type of chick, so I can't speak on that pizza, but the other 3 were really good.  So good that I ordered 2 pizzas to go for dinner throughout the week. The flavors of the meats were very good and their crust... I would consider it medium thickness, it's not Imo's thin, but it's not hand tossed... it's right in the middle.

1,"This place is amazing. 

The Yelp app came to the rescue again last night when we needed something sweet after dinner. We'd never heard of Glazee, but it came up as being close to where we were and with amazing reviews so we tried it out. 

The owner was quick to tell us that he had no employees and ran the business himself.  He makes all the ice cream himself fresh in the back.   We talked to him for a good amount of time while we stood around and sampled a few flavors - he is one interesting dude. A Harvard grad with a background in politics and engineering who  makes ice cream... I think we could have talked to him all night if other people hadn't come in needing to be helped (since he's the only employee).

I tried the cinnamon cream cheese, the chocolate cupcake and the chocolate.  It may have been the hardest decision of my life, but I went with the chocolate cupcake. Delicious.  

The portions are generous.  I got a medium cup and couldn't finish it all. 

The only minor issue was that his credit card machine wasn't working.  He uses his ipad with the little swiper attachment and it wasn't running properly. Luckily I had cash, but he told us that if we didn't it was no problem to come back and pay him next time.","Ok, here's the deal - the food is alright, but if this place wasn't so close to my office and my coworkers didn't drag me there, I wouldn't ever go.  I do appreciate the 'local' aspect, though.  There's a chalk board detailing what's organic/local and where it's from. 

The inside dining room is tiny and always crowded.  Don't plan on having a conversation because you won't be able to hear anything.  You will wait in line forever at peak times, but there's not much room, so you will either be standing out the door or with your ass in some poor diner's face. 

I find it pretty pricey for what it is.  ~ $10 for a drink, 2 [small] tacos and some rice (that's a lunch plate special). And the rice wasn't even cooked properly. It was crunchy. 

If you do happen to visit this establishment, make sure you get the guac and/or queso. We got some for the table to share and it was the best part of the meal.","Text1: This place is amazing.

If you do happen to visit this establishment, make sure you get the guac and/or queso. We got some for the table to share and it was the best part of the meal.",yes

Having tried it once, I won't be back for another go.","I loveeee indian food, but I haven't ventured to many Indian restaurants since moving here...at least not as many as I would have liked to try at this point. This is hands down the best I've had outside of the south philly/center city area. Although the decor inside is sparse borderline looks-like-theyve-been-robbed, I've eaten at hole in the walls like this before and I know that decor definitely does not make or break a meal.

 The service was great and attentive...and I should hope so because we were the only ones dining in. There were a lot of customers in and out with take out and ordering meat (they sell raw meat that is purchasable for religious customs of how the meat was prepared, but I am not sure if it is Halal or Kosher or...?)

The food was excellent, esp the okra dish and the chicken tikka masala. The garlic naan was awesome and thin / light, and the rice was steamed to perfection. Love everything we tried.

Will be back!! The food also came out quickly.","Text1: A notch above food court Asian grub.  Having tried it once, I won't be back for another go.

Our friend Jason Roebke is the offensive coordinator. We had multiple pitchers of their house margarita, which was tasty. I had the chicken enchiladas, while a few people at the table ordered the chicken nachos. My enchiladas were average, nothing special. The chicken nachos were excellent.

I would come back again if I was looking for cheap, average Mexican fare.","The Breakfast & Lunch Nook opened three weeks ago in what used to be called the Pita Hut in the Town and Country Shopping Center at Kietzke and Vassar.
It serves breakfast and lunch, both all hours it is open. It's a minimal menu serving diner food but they seem to do it well.
I tried it for breakfast today and got eggs, a hamburger patty, hash browns and a half order of biscuits and gravy. The hamburger patty was lean and well cooked, the eggs were eggs. The hash browns were the only part of the meal I didn't like. Kind of gooey and I didn't like the taste.
The biscuits and gravy were excellent, maybe the best in town. The gravy is obviously made from scratch with nice chunks of sausage and soft biscuits. 
The lunch menu is pretty simple as well. Open-faced sandwiches, hamburger or other sandwiches, salads. It's diner food done right.","Text1: I haven't dined hear in about 4 years.

1,"This rest area still looks new. They've got vending machines, a dog area & walk, clean bathrooms and A PAY PHONE! I haven't seen a payphone in years, but if you need one, they've got it. 

I wished the bathrooms had the toilet paper covers, but other than that they were clean. They've got two sets of men & women bathrooms, along with family bathrooms. Also, for the pet bathrooms they've got a large fenced in area for fido and booboo to poop and pee to their hearts delight, but remember to pick it up. No one wants to mess with that shit.","I work in the area & was excited to see a new place open up. A few of my coworkers had tried it & said they liked it so I thought I'd order some food to go. I was able to order from my phone through the app ""Beyond Menu Food Delivery"". It was very simple to use & convenient.

I ordered the lunch special, for 7.99, well 8.99 because I picked fried rice. The other options I chose was crunchy shrimp roll & hibachi shrimp. They wasn't a extra charge for shrimp, which kind of had me wondering. I picked the time pick up my order & that was that. 

The restaurant inside looks nice. It has a nice mood too it, not flashy, but doesn't look cheap. The staff greeted me & we very friendly and I was on my way with my food. 

The food - overall I wasn't very impressed. The hibachi shrimp tastes like cooked shrimp with a teriyaki sauce poured over it. The fried rice didn't taste overly fresh. The crunchy shrimp roll was 4 pieces, the rice was room temperature & the shrimp had lost its crunch. I don't know if maybe the lunch specials are precooked for efficiency or what, but my food didn't taste fresh. The special also comes with miso soup that I didn't care for & the vegetable tempura was okay, I'd rather have had steamed vegetables. On a positive note I enjoyed the ginger dressing on the salad. I don't know if that comes from a bottle or not. 

Overall I'd maybe try it again in a dine in setting, when the restaurant is busy, but I won't do the lunch to go order again.","Text1: This rest area still looks new.

0,"I was so excited for them to open and my experience just sucked.  I hate to say that, but from start to finish it just wasn't that great.  

The tables are packed in. I understand wanting to maximize the space, but tables are uncomfortably close.  Our server looked miserable constantly squeezing out of someone's way.  

I was very unimpressed with the food.  I ordered the boneless wings after our server said they were fantastic.  They were not. I don't mind dry chicken, I think it can nearly always be overcome with a good sauce.  They were SO DRY, they were nearly inedible.  I couldn't even cut them with my butter knife.  They were also tiny.  I would estimate there was no more than 6 oz. of meat in my 8 wings.  I had requested celery, but it did not arrive.  I told my server and he told me that celery was an upcharge.  I told him it was included, but to just bring me fries.  He ended up bringing me fries and celery. I'm not sure if he checked the menu or just decided to give the celery to me.  I checked the menu again before writing my review and it is definitely supposed to be included with the wings.  The blue cheese and buffalo sauces were fine, nothing spectacular.  The fries were mushy, underdone, and underseasoned.  I ended up leaving half of them on the plate (if you knew me, you'd know how shockingly out of character that is).  And by leave them on the ""plate"", I mean leave them on the paper container they came in.  Everything came in cardboard containers.  Very weird and super wasteful.","Yep, one of the most underrated happy hours in the city.  Now granted, there is plenty of room, not crowded until later, and you are not going to find a host of singles to fulfill your alcohol induced desires.  But to meet a friend in old city, a young, sexy blonde friend who just wants to hang on to your arm and stare into your blue eyes, and to be able to hear each other converse (hey millennials, do you know what 'converse' means), a cool, relaxed happy hour atmosphere is what you have.

$3 beers, and I mean REAL beers like Terrapin Hi-5 IPA (normally $7), and on Thursday The Twisted Tail's version of a classic cocktail like a Manhattan for $5, you kidding me?  The red wine on special blew, so knock yourself out and pay retail for something.  $4-$6 small happy hour food items on the menu.  We had $6 for 6 oysters, tender, nice sized blue points, great cocktail and hot sauces.  (That's a buck-a-shuck, for those counting at home).  The chorizo taco was very nice, very tender, a good split just for a taste.  The spicy salmon poke was average, missing something, some sort of tangy bite I think.  

From the regular menu, the harpoon-caught swordfish was 5 star all the way, with perfectly, and I mean perfectly cooked, snappy snap peas.  The fish so tender and fresh, so melt in your mouth with exceptional taste-bud tingling, one of the best I've ever had.

After drinking a ton of $3 beers, my appetite was still alive, had to try the desserts.

0,"Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.  The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.  

True to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.  Finally, my sushi sample of an Eel & Avocado Roll was average, with much more Avo than Eel, and artificially colored Wasabe and Ginger.  

Bottom Line - The suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here.  Everything was accommodating to the local market.  Too much broccoli, and not enough real heat. Not bad if this is what you are looking for.","I generally am not a big fan of big box discount stores, but I tolerate Target a whole lot more than Wal Mart. I like this particular Target.

Appetizer of stuffed mushrooms was disappointingly bland bread stuffing. The Duck was a rubbery half breast with a tasty blackberry sauce. But way too much pepper seasoning as was the half mashed potatoes: wild rice would be a better pairing. The broccoli and carrot side was the best part. Chicken dish was ok. 
The chocolate creme brûlée was exceptional good, highly recommend.  
The atmosphere is nice, a little shabby but not offensive. 
Service was friendly and attentive. 
We had one glass of wine and an $80 bill seemed high for the quality.","Went early on a Wednesday night between the holidays and it got packed quick. Wait staff was wonderful constantly looking for what you needed refilled. 
I asked the waiter for chicken Marsala oddly not on the menu since the veal was. It is a simple dish that I use to compare Italian restaurants. Should have went with the veal, as they did not know how to prepare the chicken. It must have come out of the freezer and they forgot to tenderize it. 
Shrimp scampi was good, as was the salad. 
We had a group of six celebrating our kids engagement so they sharply provided a large serving of tiramisu which they make in-house and was worth the meal. 
The bill was a bit of shock at $45 per, but you pay for the nice ambience.","Text1: Well we came here because Yelp listed it in the best seafood search engine. What a misleading search result. They have only 4 fish choices. We had Duck and Chicken instead.

We got veggie blue corn nachos (we added chicken) which had fresh squash and tomatoes some onion. Just really good. Also we shared the macadamia nut crusted Mahi mahi on top of fresh veggies and purple mashed potatoes. A huge fillet of fresh fish. All very fresh and light. Just a fantastic meal and atmosphere. We sat outside near tiki torches on shell gravel. Ppl had dogs. It was lovely.",no
0,"So, about 20 min before 5 friends and I went to the restaurant to celebrate one of the ladies' birthday, I called.  When we walked in, they had our table for 6 ready for us.  

Double Shot Amaretto Sours for drink order and they were great!  We were off to a great start.

Appetizers : Zucchini Bites & Toasted Ravs (see pics).  Excellent in taste.  Really enjoyed the sauces they served with the zucchini.  Zucchini portion is enough for a table to share.  The Ravs were larger than your normal ravs and packed with flavorful meat.  There are only 4 Ravs, so order accordingly.

Entrees: (see pics) Seared Scallops, Cedar Salmon, Crab Cakes & Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  OMG, everything tasted exceptional!  We truly enjoyed the entrees.  What I loved is that each entree is available in a petit or large portion.  The flavors were spot on and well balanced.  The sides were very complimentary to the main focus of the plate.  I have to say the Sauteed Spinach and the Vanilla Sweet Potatos...oh wow...I could eat a plate of those for dinner several times over.

We didn't have room for dessert, however, the restaurant was kind enough to provide the BDay girl with a free dessert, which you don't find too often anymore.  They also brought the table 6 mini chocolate chip cookies that were complimentary.. they even tasted good.

Picking this restaurant was a last minute rush decision, but we are not disappointed that the evening took us here.  Will most definitely be back.  Kudos to the chef!!","Upscale comfort food is making a comeback! The newest addition to the Sbraga family had received many mixed reviews. The Zucchini bread with soft butter as a main starter is a MUST. Can I get the recipe please?? BBQ ribs: rich flavor and big portions! served with toasted white bread. Other items are ""predictable"", no surprises because most people have had these foods in their lives.","Text1: So, about 20 min before 5 friends and I went to the restaurant to celebrate one of the ladies' birthday, I called.

1,"I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated. I hadn't been back here for a while and it continues to serve great pies.  The renovated entrance has improved the congestion at door.

This trip we tried the Blanca, which was a  nice change from tomatoes and meats, but the appeal wore off after a slice or two.  This would be great one to share with a group, so everyone can try something different. The Siciliana was absolutely perfect -- the sauce is divine and that thin, quick baked crust is how all pizza should be.

My only gripe with this chain is the poor quality of the Parmesan cheese. I just don't understand why they offer that awful, powdery stuff to put on such a quality pie.","I have been craving Lebanese food for a while and finally made it here.  It has been substantially dressed up since I was last here and the prices reflect that. They now  have an extensive wine cellar housed in a glass-walled closet that dominates the place.  The entree plates are around $25.  Staff do not seem very familiar with middle Eastern cuisine and weren't very able to describe the dishes.

I had a starter of hummus which was good, a little more garlic and sesame flavour wouldn't hurt. Pita bread was cold and little dry.  Clearly not made in house, or that day.

Chicken on skewers was very tasty and consisted on four metal skewers, another pita and a very tasty garlic spread.

Dining mate had pizza which was very thick-crusted, but the ham was very good.

So all in all, the meal was good but I left still craving my shawarma fix.","Text1: I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated.

1,"Do you long for poor quality drinks served in plastic cups all the while the smell of vomit and urine assault you? Then you'll love the quarter! If you want great wine, thoughtfully handcrafted cocktails, great food, live music, and amazing service, then consider coming here instead.","Love the concept...and apparently so does half the city.

The Bro menu and Bro Baristas make this place feel real. Customer service and all feels legit. It doesn't feel BASIC... There was a long line in the drive through, so we just parked and I ordered from the small window. Remember, this place LARGE is actually LARGE. No Venti here lol.","Great business model. Have drinks and paint. Best of all, have a professional teaching you how to paint. I would like to give this place 5 stars but honestly felt rushed.

1,"If you seek to eat a plant based or healthier diet, this Whole Foods Market is as good as it gets.

Brand new and totally redesigned from the traditional WF footprint, this is laid out to withstand any challenge from their mega competitors on all ends of the segment - low price chains like Wal Mart and high end chains like Wegmans. As a health market or organic store - it has no peer. 

Well lit, spacious, with windows all around to allow the sun to shine in, it gives off a relaxing vibe for healthy food shopping to take place.

The employees are extremely helpful and friendly. I couldn't find an item and two employees set me on the right direction. The check out worker we met had two huge safety pins from customer shout outs for her awesome service. 

The selection was excellent. A large number of Gardein items I can't find easily anywhere else. Plenty of Beyond burgers on hand. Fresh produce. Store made bread. 

We didn't get to it on this trip but we will the next time try a meal in the restaurant on the first floor. 

I realize this place takes a bad rap on higher prices but we found them comparable to the other markets in this category.

Parking in the front might get tight but there was more parking around the back.

If this is the future of WF, it's one I enthusiastically embrace and highly recommend.","I admit it - I am a  pizza snob. 

As a boy growing up in North Jersey I cut my teeth on New York style, thin crispy crust. I am sorry that there was a time in my life that I thought ALL pizzas were great ( college years primarily, where mass quantities of beer and possibly other things were involved). I am older now and hopefully wiser. 

Having been to mecca - New York City's greatest pizzerias -  and specifically, the best pizzeria in the USA - Di Faras in Brooklyn, I have been ruined as far as most pizza sold around here. 

Dont get me wrong - The City of Brotherly Shove has undergone a  pizza renaissance with Nomad, SLiCE,Beddia, Pizza Brain and many others.Trenton's not far and a trip to DeLorenzo's is worth the travel time as its delicious. It's just in Delco, top pizzas are hard to find. Many are subjective, acquired tastes (Gennaros in Springfield, New London in Prospect Park, Rennatos in Swarthmore are all stellar locally). NY Style is just not found in Delco.

But if you look around, occasionally you are surprised as I was at Goose Creek Grill in West Chester.

They have several cold beers on tap - required when eating pizza ( great pizza and cold beer...one of life's finest pleasures). I ordered a ice cold Stella. It was great.Unfortunately that is it for alcohol so my girlfriend was out of luck as wine is BYOB. She had a coke.

She ordered the pulled pork sandwich and liked it. She also liked the sweet potato fries. I had the Caesar salad which was tasty - heavy on the garlic flavor.

Of course, I had the margarita pizza and was really impressed. The crust was light and crispy(order well done). The tomato sauce was thick.Could have used more cheese. Overall, this was a good pizza.

1,"Always 5 stars for delicious food I can get without having to walk too far from my house. (But they also deliver!)

This was a little hole-in-the-wall with a tiny menu when they first opened. Since then, they have spruced up the decor and expanded their menu. And the food, which was delicious on day one, has seriously improved. The al pastor pork is consistently the best I've eaten, and the other meat options are equally good. I usually go for tacos and keep it simple, while Boyfriend has fallen in food love with the sopes. I really need to come here more often and try some other things on the menu.

You can easily get a filling meal for two for under $20, which includes a little basket of nachos topped with beans and cheese, and two amazing salsas. Service isn't super friendly, but they get the job done and the food is delicious so I'm not going to complain.","When it comes to seafood, you get what you pay for. Is Ippolito's pricey? Yes. Is the seafood amazing? Yes. I will go nowhere else for shellfish. The last time I ate shrimp from here, they were gigantic and tasted like the ocean. The dry packed sea scallops are absolutely perfect. I thought it was not possible to get mind-blowing seafood in Philly, but I was wrong.

In addition to fresh seafood, you can pick up a number of cooked dishes, fresh salads, sushi, and some produce and groceries including fresh bread. The crab cake sandwich is outstanding, as is the cole slaw if you're a cole slaw fan. The take-out menu is my new bucket list.

So far, I have found the service to be friendly and quick. Zero complaints.

A word of caution: if you see the lobster mac and cheese on the menu and think, wow I really want to try that, you need to call a day ahead to get some. I have not yet tried it because I walked in thinking I could just pick some up. Made-to-order means it is probably awesome, so I'm not going to complain about it, though at the time I may have done some foot-stomping until they gave me a sample of crab tomato gravy. Much like giving a kid a lollipop, it shut me right the hell up.","Text1: Always 5 stars for delicious food I can get without having to walk too far from my house. (But they also deliver!)

This pizza is huge, and cheap, and dripping with cheese.  Seriously, oozing cheese.  It is St. Louis style pizza, so if you hate Imo's I would steer clear of this pie, but if you are a fan, guess what, it's cheaper and they don't charge for delivery.  Granted, they don't have the same fabulous salad, but if you want pizza, this is your place.  Also, the cheese garlic bread is delicious.  I am a huge fan.

I almost could give these guys 5 stars because they are open so awesomely late (they deliver till 3am) which is certainly a plus when you are up late after a long night out with friends and desperately want some pizza.  Even when you order it this late, the pizza is still piping hot, too.

I unrolled my silverware and there was cheese encrusted all over the fork to where the prongs were not even visible. Ok, strike one but not the worst I've seen so lets just grab another fork and move on.  

I make my way over to the buffet which was fried chicken and red beans and rice and I've heard good things about it so I was looking forward to trying it.

Clearly, he died from red beans and rice overdose or as I like to call them, red beans and flies. Strike 3. 

Judging from the other reviews it seems like I went on a very off day so I'd be willing to try it again, but long after this memory has been erased from my brain.","Zagol's food is absolutely delicious, but you have to be willing to try something new.

The injera (the flat bread) was not what I expected it was going to be.  It is served cold, and it reminds me of a sponge, but you quickly get over that once you taste all of wonderful food!  
A large group of us went and we ordered a lot of food - Doro Wat, Alicha, Key Wat, Gored Gored, and Zilzil Tibs all of which were amazing.
The only thing I would change is to have more of the bread, because in my opinion they didn't serve enough of it in comparison to the amount of food they give you.

1,"I came to Kanella for dinner after reading about it on yelp.  I was super excited to go because it seemed like a gem in the Philly byo scene.   Unfortunately, I thought it was very average.  The food was good, and the service was good but I didn't think it was a very memorable experience.  

There restaurant itself is very cute and the server was super friendly.  Our waiter was not particularly nice but not rude either.  As for the food, it was good.

I wasn't impressed by the pita that came with the hummus, I was expecting more fluffy pita, but it was thin and a little limp (but it was warm!).  The octopus app was very nicely done, probably the highlight of the evening. The chopped vegetables accompanied the octopus very nicely.  The entrees were also good, but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the calamari dish, and my friends got the quail, lamb, and a white fish (I forget the exact one).  I tried a few bites of each.

1,"I've heard good things about The Burger Joint for awhile but don't make the trek out for burgers very often. Well, well, things finally worked out and we came to check out the BJ on a Saturday afternoon. Great nickname eh?

It's located in the same plaza as Loma House. The menu is simple; 10 signature burgers to choose from (2 are vegetarian) or else it's BYOB.  

- Curly fries ($3.75) - fries were piping hot, crunchy, crispy and come with two side dips (homemade ketchup and tartar sauce).

- Sunrise chicken ($8.99) - this one tasted like summer; sweet, light and refreshing.

- Spicy crunch ($8.99) - this burger was completely different and was a nice change of pace. We both preferred the spicy crunch; it was meatier and more satisfying.

Pretty solid place to grab some gourmet style burgers. I'd hit this place up again if I were planning to stuff my face a la Guy Fieri style. 3.5 stars.","If you've never heard of B's Diner before, welcome to the club. Located on the east side of the tracks on Whyte, you'll easily pass their sign if you aren't looking specifically for it. However, it is definitely worth seeking out. I was shocked/impressed that they have an actual nice, quaint little patio outside to eat and people watch. This would definitely be an awesome little spot in the summer, reminds me of Montreal a little bit. Hidden gem indeeed (just look for Daawat and it is just a bit west of the Indian restaurant).

We went on an early Friday for dinner and there were only a couple people inside mulling around. One super easy going lady was working the whole restaurant (waitress, runner, chef) - impressive! Don't know how she does it when it gets busy but big props to her. They had some chill beats going on in the background, a little hippity hop, which I am always in approval of.

We decided to share:

- Buta belly ramen burger ($11.00) - if you've never had a ramen burger (my first time!), it's worth a try. The ramen is cooked so the noodles are soft and tender and stuffed with pork belly, arugula (more like mixed greens), green onions and a spicy Japanese mayo sauce. The sauce had just a hint of spice to it but gave the burger a nice kick to it. It was good but the amount of ramen noodles were a bit overwhelming for me. A bit too much gluten pour moi.
-  Vietnamese lemongrass pork ($15.00) - one of their special dishes for the evening. Came with a fried egg, cucumber and tomato garnish, spring rolls and jasmine rice. The spring rolls were dope! I don't usually brag about how good spring rolls are but these were perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. The jasmine rice was disappointing - you need to dump the fish sauce over it to give it any sort of taste. Overall, dish wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Should have tried the polish potato pancake with schnitzel!  Bah. 

The dish also came with choose between soup (borscht or miso) and salad (just a tossed salad according to our waitress). Easiest  choice - BORSCHT all the way. At a diner? Hell's yeah. The soup was flavourful and full of delicious beet(ness). Mix in the dollop of sour cream and you are golden.
- We ended our meal with a complimentary cookie from the chef. How sweet of her! Chocolate chip and chocolate chip with M&M - they were a bit hard but whatever, they were free.

Will have to come back to try out their Polish dishes! Perogies for sure next time. Dingy but interesting hole in the wall diner that is worth a try.","Text1: I've heard good things about The Burger Joint for awhile but don't make the trek out for burgers very often. Well, well, things finally worked out and we came to check out the BJ on a Saturday afternoon. Great nickname eh?

It's located in the same plaza as Loma House. The menu is simple; 10 signature burgers to choose from (2 are vegetarian) or else it's BYOB.  

- Curly fries ($3.75) - fries were piping hot, crunchy, crispy and come with two side dips (homemade ketchup and tartar sauce).

- Sunrise chicken ($8.99) - this one tasted like summer; sweet, light and refreshing.

- Spicy crunch ($8.99) - this burger was completely different and was a nice change of pace. We both preferred the spicy crunch; it was meatier and more satisfying.

Pretty solid place to grab some gourmet style burgers. I'd hit this place up again if I were planning to stuff my face a la Guy Fieri style. 3.5 stars. 

 Text2: If you've never heard of B's Diner before, welcome to the club. Located on the east side of the tracks on Whyte, you'll easily pass their sign if you aren't looking specifically for it. However, it is definitely worth seeking out. I was shocked/impressed that they have an actual nice, quaint little patio outside to eat and people watch. This would definitely be an awesome little spot in the summer, reminds me of Montreal a little bit. Hidden gem indeeed (just look for Daawat and it is just a bit west of the Indian restaurant).

We went on an early Friday for dinner and there were only a couple people inside mulling around. One super easy going lady was working the whole restaurant (waitress, runner, chef) - impressive! Don't know how she does it when it gets busy but big props to her. They had some chill beats going on in the background, a little hippity hop, which I am always in approval of.

We decided to share:

- Buta belly ramen burger ($11.00) - if you've never had a ramen burger (my first time!), it's worth a try. The ramen is cooked so the noodles are soft and tender and stuffed with pork belly, arugula (more like mixed greens), green onions and a spicy Japanese mayo sauce. The sauce had just a hint of spice to it but gave the burger a nice kick to it. It was good but the amount of ramen noodles were a bit overwhelming for me. A bit too much gluten pour moi.
-  Vietnamese lemongrass pork ($15.00) - one of their special dishes for the evening. Came with a fried egg, cucumber and tomato garnish, spring rolls and jasmine rice. The spring rolls were dope!

1,"Typical (awesome) P.F. Chang's food and atmosphere, fantastic service.

One of Norman's classic principles of design was the concept of consistency - P.F. Chang's China Bistro, amongst a few other notable national chains, certainly delivers on this front.  The food is always very good with the veggie lettuce wraps (always a no brainer), eggplant in garlic sauce (also very good), ma po tofu (must I keep going with the compliments), and banana spring rolls rounding up the veggie components of our family-style dinner.  (Although I did want it all for myself...)

This was the first time that I felt really special in a P.F. Chang's location, and 100% of the credit here goes to our server, Paul.  He was very good with suggestions for the first-timers, and all in all, definitely helped make our experience as special as it was.

Long story short, great food, great service, great ambiance - a must visit.","After a recent visit to P.F.

0,"Companion is one of the best lunch spots in Clayton.  The menu is salads, sandwiches and soups.  If you get there on the earlier side you may be able to grab some of their delicious baked eggs or oatmeal.  I actually worked at companion back in 2001... What a change it has gone through, but the food is still just as yummy.  

My salad rotation goes between the Picnic Basket and the Go Green... But all of the salads are a good sized portion with lots of goodness in them.  You can't go wrong with any of the salads.  The sandwiches are all also great - my husband loves the Frenchie, I love the Mermaid or the regular chicken salad sandwich or the Fa La La... YUM, the breads are all made in house.

I will always love Companion and go for lunch a lot - it's basically every week at this point.","Patched my tire within several minutes of arriving.  In and out for $20.

Much better than waiting an ENTIRE DAY for Firestone to patch it.  I'll come back again.  Can't speak to them performing more complex repairs, but looked promising.

Kristin decided to continue the downward spiral of poor customer service my attacking me via email and in the note attached to this review.

All-you-can-eat mussels on Sunday.  Sounds like a good deal.  If you stick with a bowl or two, they are extremely tasty and well done.  However, bowl number three always reminds me  to quite while I'm a head.  For $16, you'll get your moneys worth, as the deal also comes with a salad and paste with each mussel order (if you'd like). 

Service is really hit or miss.  Dawn is great, but I believe she might no longer be there.  On the other hand, Kristin needs to learn key aspects of customer service.  For a place with decent food and solid specials, she alone has managed to keep me from frequenting there more often.","Big fan of 1 Tippling Place!

I'm a fancy cocktail guy.  There are a plenty of options in the city if you know where to look.  They all have some attributes in common: drinks are $10-$15 each, heavy on the liquor, high on the flavor.  The atmosphere also has standards, for example no standing and the requirement that you dress like you belong.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that Tipping Place has all of these.

So what exactly has me giving Tippling a ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" rating?  Unlike some of the other cocktail bars in the city, you can actually come in and look around instead of waiting in line outside.  May not seem like much, but it is nice in the winter and means you can be late to meeting up with friends without feeling like you're holding them back from grabbing a drink.  Another little thing, I like their seats.  Yes, some of the old timy furniture could use an update, but they are damn comfortable. 

The drinks are fancy and I like them regardless of how they make me look (with the occasional 'girly' glass in front of me).  I like how Tippling has a regular menu along with Special/Seasonal drinks.  It is nice to find your old favorite once in a while.  Beyond that, service is reasonable and location is convenient.

1,"With its combination of Polynesian, Spanish, American, Chinese (and other Asian influences), Filipino food can be a challenge to the uninitiated. My wife and I recently joined a group of perhaps 30 Yelpers for dinner at Cafe de Manila, providing a great opportunity to try a variety of flavors. Although it took a while to get the first orders out, the friendly staff did a pretty good job under the circumstances.

First up, Lumpia ($7.95), thin and crispy pork egg rolls served with a spicy-sweet chili sauce. I've enjoyed lumpia many times, and these did not disappoint. Following was Tokwa't Baboy ($9.95), bite-sized pork belly and tofu chunks stacked together and deep-fried, served with a mixture of soy sauce and vinegar. If you love both bacon and Asian food, you'll want this for breakfast. And lunch. And, well, you get the idea.

Next was something I just couldn't abide, Mangga at Bagoong ($5.95), a paste of mashed mango and salted, fermented shrimp. No, no, no. Even the smell was bad enough that I had to move that bowl to an adjacent, empty table. An acquired taste, I presume.

Thankfully, the next item was Laing ($7.95), a delicious mess of shredded taro leaves cooked with coconut milk and ginger, akin to Indian Saag. The leaves were a little tougher than most cooked greens, but the dish was one I'd order again. Even better was Chicken Adobo ($8.95), featuring chunks of chicken cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, bay leaf, garlic, and whole peppercorns. My wife and I probably enjoyed this stew the best of all items sampled.

The menu described Pork Menudo ($8.95) as pork meat stew with liver cubes, chickpeas, potatoes, and tomato sauce. My wife took the leftovers for lunch and reported, ""This was similar in flavor to the adobo, though I couldn't detect any liver. Under bright office lighting I realized the meat was actually chunks of hot dog, and there were raisins as well. Very different from the description."" Maybe they weren't prepared for our large group and had to improvise.

Pancit (noodle) dishes are a mainstay and Pancit Palabok ($7.95) sounded amazing, with rice noodles, prawn, smoked fish flake, shrimp, sliced hard-boiled egg, crunchy chicharon, and orange sauce. Yet, I couldn't detect much--if any--shrimp or prawn, though there was plenty of fish flake, egg, chicharon (fried pork rind) and orange sauce. Not something I'd want every day (or week), but good enough I'd like to try it from a different restaurant for comparison.

Kare Kare ($10.95), a stew of oxtail with mixed vegetables cooked in peanut sauce is something I've had better tastes of in the past. The texture of the veggies was odd, and the peanut sauce seemed ""off"". Not terrible, but just not as good as I know it can be. Last of the entrees, Dinuguan ($8.95), the pork meat stew basted in pork blood and serrano chiles colloquially known as ""Chocolate Meat"". My wife found this to be ""tasty, but rich. A few bites is enough, more would be too much."" To my eyes it looked like chunky, dark chocolate pudding (hence the nickname), with a livery smell. Folks who like organ meats enjoyed it, but I can't say I'm a fan.

Finally dessert, beginning with Ube Halaya ($4.99), a cake of mashed ube root (purple yam) cooked with brown sugar, and condensed/evaporated milks. My wife and I agreed it's a pretty shade of purple, but it looks like Play-Doh® and doesn't taste much better. However, the Leche Flan ($4.99) was really outstanding. As with the Mexican variety, this custard is made of egg yolks and milk topped with caramel syrup, but we found Cafe de Manila's rendition to be superior in both flavor and texture. A perfect end to this gastronomic adventure.","My wife and I went for another visit to Sushi Rose, and I'm happy to say this cute little spot remains one of our favorite ""hidden gems"". Good service, great food, pleasant atmosphere, very competitive price for AYCE sushi.  Their menu is much simpler than many Reno options, which my wife and I actually appreciate; neither of us are fans of the huge, deep-fried & heavily sauced maki rolls favored by some well-known Reno sushi haunts.

Here's how good & fresh Sushi Rose is: my wife ordered almost nothing but raw maki and nigiri last night, whereas her usual orders at Sushi Pier 1 and Hiroba are the veggie tempura and cooked shrimp/crab items.  Sushi Rose removed her sushi training wheels!   :)

Now we just have to hope that this place remains popular enough to stay in business, but not so popular that it goes down the drainpipe like so many others have.

P.S. My wife noticed the menu has special AYCE prices for kids under 11, making it more affordable to bring the young'uns.

We tried the concord grape and avocado pops. If you're a sugar-lovin' person, go for the grape. The avocado is much more mild. The smell of baked goods in the air also led us to order a strawberry filled sugar cookie whoopie pie which was on the dry side but rockin' in the flavor department. I could have gone for a whole scoop of that filling. The pops were not the best we've ever encountered so I'm going to throw my chips into the baked goods next time.

1,"The thing about City Park is there are a lot of cool little things that are in the park that you might not even realize are there. Couturie Forest is one of those spots.

A photographer friend of mine actually introduced me to this place and while the term ""forest"" is probably a bit generous, I would say that it's more of a nature based hiking trail. If you have ever been to the hiking trails at Jean Lafitte, I would say that it's along those lines.

There are nice little trails throughout the forest with different plants and greenery all around. I really enjoyed walking through the shady parts, since it was rather hot on the day I visited I think the trail is open late-until 7 or 8, so it would be a good spot to check out on a late afternoon when the sun is starting to set.","Since it's Spring, I decided to get the yard together.

Bantings is HUGE and probably has any type of plant you could ever want. They even have veggies and herbs, in case you want to start you own garden.

0,"So, I have never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel because well I live here and who cares. However, I am rating the lobby because even a non corporate, simple, no frills gal like me must give pause to a hotel that has a river with boat tours in it's lobby. 

All the plants are live, fountains with colored back lights, lovely trails, koi ponds, make this a must visit place even for locals. I like to go in the winter when it's cold out and I need to see some green. It definitely lifts my mood. Of course they do a pretty spectacular Christmas presentation as well so if you are looking for an affordable Christmas experience, then just take the family for a stroll  through the lobby during December. We usually treat ourselves a festive holiday drink. 

Here is the trick to the parking. Opryland charges for parking but we park over at the mall and cut through cause I am cheap and the mall parking is free.","Great place to try if you are looking for a nice romantic place to dine in Nashville. The second floor dining area offers a great view of Nashville skyline in the evening. Food and service was excellent, and surprisingly not very expensive either (well maybe the drinks are, but not the food). The place is located in Gulch, a nice/hip area of somewhat downtown Nashville, with boutique shops and other restaurants, and parking is still relatively cheap.","Text1: So, I have never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel because well I live here and who cares.

Service was great and food was top notch:
- Foie gras soup (his famous dish)
- Grilled octopus
- Lamb rigitoni

There's a 4 course tasting menu for $50, which is a steal compared to some of the other top restaurants in the city.","Ugh.  I hate having to downgrade Izumi because I still believe the sushi is amazing.  My husband even raved about his dish and the sashimi.  I think my main concern is that they don't understand their ingredients.  If you're someone with a dietary restriction, that's a big problem (if you don't have any food allergies, then feel free to ignore my review).  We listed my allergies on our reservation and the chef approached me immediately, which I truly appreciated.  But, then it got weird...he recommended tamari for me despite the fact that I listed a soy allergy (tamari is made from fermented soybeans).  I know that it doesn't always cause reactions for certain people, but I really didn't want to risk it.  He insisted that it would be safe, though, since its ""wheat-free.""  Huh?  I'm not gluten intolerant, so I was really confused by his statement.  He then advised that I order their spicy tuna, even though I'm fairly certain that's made with mayonnaise (egg is another allergy for me).  I ended up ordering vegetarian rolls just to stay on the safe side and it worked out fine, but the ordering process and meal definitely made me nervous.  This is a great spot if you don't have any limitations, but I can no longer recommend this place if you need detailed information about each dish.","Text1: Excellent restaurant from Top Chef winner Kevin Sbraga.

They had most of your standard breakfast foods. I got an eggs Benedict, and it was what you would expect. Location close to Rittenhouse is great, and the atmosphere is lively.

Every worker there was bitching and moaning and barely noticed the huge line of people trying to get some food. The plopped stuff onto the dishes just like that one lunch-lady who you always thought spit into your chili. You know the one. That one who smoked in the back and emptied her ashes into the food vats before filling them up. See? I knoew you would remember her.

1,"Set on the north west corner of 18th and Cleary, the entrance can be easily missed. Parking here is tight, and handicap access is tricky. This cafeteria style French café is so cute and comforting somehow.

I have always had a soft spot in my heart for La Madeleine's. My first visit to this chain was some 20 years ago or so, when I came to visit my older sister, and she brought me to one for lunch. You walk in, go through the cafeteria type line, pick what you want, pay and order, then pick your seat. Any food that needs to be made will be brought out to you. The staff are all friendly, even when the line seems to be a million miles long. The cookies and baked goods all look so delicious.

Their soups are wonderful, and made in house. Their sandwiches are all good, as are their quiches.  During peak periods, it can get a bit messy inside, but there is always someone walking around, sweeping the floors and bussing the tables. The restrooms are almost always clean and well stocked.","I am right in the middle of the road here. The parking lot is ample. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays. I would think they would do a lot of business on Sundays, but I am not a business owner. There is outdoor seating on the front porch. Walking in, the hostess stand is immediately to your right, the bar is to the left, and the dining room is on your right. They do evidently have poker machines in an enclosed room. Everything is neat and clean, if a bit dark. The restrooms are neat, clean and well stocked.

Last night, I had their special, which was the seafood lasagne. Layers of cheese, noodles, shrimp, crawfish, clams and yummy-ness that when I couldn't finish, it reheated nicely for lunch today. The rest of the food is just ok. You can expect the same at any other chain restaurant, which they are not a chain, but it is just the same. They have no sweet tea, but depending on the waitress, they will add simple syrup, though not all of the wait staff will. Pieces of room temperature bread will be served with your meal, with butter that you can add, but it's not warm enough to melt the butter and does not seem to be homemade.

I will continue to be an occasional patron, but it isn't going to be a regular visit for me.","Text1: Set on the north west corner of 18th and Cleary, the entrance can be easily missed.

The bread pudding muffin was very good ...I don't necessarily believe that it was intended to be a breakfast item, but it worked!  They warmed it up and put a nice icing on it, delightful (4 stars).  As for the bagel sandwich, it wasn't mind-blowingly different than what you'd expect but was tasty nonetheless (3.5 stars).

We loved the cappuccinos and the friendly service.  I'd happily return to Henry's the next time I'm downtown looking for caffeine/breakfast.","This is where to go for a great hot dog in Philly. Beyond hot dogs, it's fries and some quirky pickled thing I would not even begin to try. But really, who goes to a hot dog joint for anything pickled?

Anyway, this was my second venture to Hot Diggity and it was delightful. This time around, I got the The Seattle Grunge and The Fiesta Dog. I felt these lighter/cooler toppings were more in line with summer weather.

The Seattle Grunge is Smothered with garlic cream cheese and onions. The Fiesta Dog is topped with fresh made guacamole and pico de gallo. Both were delish to the nines. They have pretty good fries, and a boat load of sauces to dip them in. 

During my first visit, it was colder and I got a couple of warmer feeling dogs. The Texas Hold 'Em is wrapped in and has BBQ and hot sauce on it. The Cincinnati Skyline is loaded with chili and cheese sauce. These two dogs were also bangin.

My wife is a huge fan of The Big Kahuna. It's not my thing, but really no knock on it. I'm just not into the whole pineapple on my hot dog thing.

The eggs benedict was everything they said it would be. I added a potato latke because everyone kept raving about it and it was delicious (although, it's hard to fry a potato and make it not delicious to me!) with a necessary side of apple sauce and sour cream- yum! 

I can definitely see what all the hype is about. I like the benches outside for waiting if it's nice weather and they have outdoor seating, which is always a plus.

There's no indoor seating, so it's a pick up and go or get delivery kind of place, but I love ordering from there whenever I'm visiting in East Nashville.

I remember when I picked it up after ordering, the employee behind the counter greeted me with a 'so you're who ordered that pizza'.  Not really sure if that was to him a good or bad thing but he was jovial when he said it.  

As good as it is, their pizza is not what makes them stand out to me.  They're Feta Cheese sticks are so delicious, and the amount they give you is amazing, you could really order that instead of a pizza and be full.  They offer salads, sandwiches and other pizaa shop type food but its their wings that I will recommend to anyone thinking of eating here.  They are hands down the best I've had in Nashville so far.  First of all they're huge, nothing like the wimpy chicken wings you get in most places.  I can easily say they're twice the size of your average wing, and they cook them until they're so tender the meat falls into your mouth.  They only have three flavors, but they're all so tasty you could eat them every day.  The mild wings are a dry rub which is deliciously unusual and come with banana peppers sprinkled on top, the hot wings are wet and come with jalapenos and the bbq come with pineapple.

Give it a try, I think you'll like it!","Not authentic or palate surprising, but it's worth checking out. Order the strangest things on the menu and you will probably be the most pleased. 

The Korean BBQ taco I got was the best. Other tasty ones are Local BBQ, Texas Brisket, and Carnitas. The fish was okay but tasted a little like fish sticks in a flour tortilla. I would have liked to try the lamb or fried oyster tacos listed on the special board but they said they didn't have them that night. (Then take down the sign please)

It was a fun place to be with a big group of people. I'd come back with a group sometime to check out some of the weirder specials but probably wouldn't be my first choice to come back randomly on my own.","Text1: This is a fun place to eat.

0,"Have made several trips to Mac's so far and I have not a bad thing to say. Good selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles and cans (and just clap ya hands). Draft list is constantly rotating so I haven't seen the same beer twice.

Gravy fries with mozzarella are legit as well as the roasted garlic hummus. The short rib jack-stack burger alone is worth the trip. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare topped with braised short ribs, pepper jack cheese and a mango habanero ketchup. Not for someone who can't handle the heat. I've had the crab cake sandwich as well and not a ton of filler in this one. 

Although I'm no expert in bird law and you can't get a milk steak here, I would recommend you give it a try.",It wasn't my favorite bar of the bar hop. The beers on tap on this particular day were just to craft for my Liking. The unique decor is nice but not inviting. Definitely not allot of space to hang with a group.

Beck's version of the NOLA cheese steak is also worth gaining a few extra lbs. It is filled with delicious spicy sausage and extra seasoned for the creole kick to the mouth. 

The staff is super friendly here and will give you a sample of anything before you commit to purchasing which is great if you don't know what level of heat you can handle. The line is usually barely as well, in comparison the other other places around. Beck's you got me boo.","The new owner has kept the old menu from Steve's but the food is even better.

You'd never guess this gem was here but its only one mile off the highway. A simple sign notes the entrance and then, voila, you're surrounded by nature with a hint of the sound of highway traffic in the distance. After seeing the photos on Yelp and hearing about this place from Yelper Katie U, I had to check it out for myself! In an effort to spend more time outdoors and in parks this year, Ritchey Woods Nature Preserve was a welcome addition to the lineup. 

What will you find here?

-boardwalk trail leading through a swamp filled with slender trees, wood ducks and beautiful water reflections 

-mini community library and reading cove with seating and shade

-several well-maintained trails leading throughout the property - all are very tidy and friendly for children and the elderly (if you're looking for a challenging hike - this isn't it)

-spiffy restrooms 

-covered picnic area that is very new and well laid out with picnic benches and only a stone's throw from the parking lot

Alright, now it's time for you to hop off here, grab a book, throw on your tennis shoes and head to Ritchey Woods Nature Preserve and see for yourself.","I go to school at St. Joe's which is very close to honeygrow. I have been here many times because of how convenient it is to stop here to get dinner before class. I love a lot about this place. Honestly, I really do. The selection is exceptional and I really like the build-your-own stir fry option. In addition, I am a big fan of the fact that everything is local. My only two gripes about this place are pretty benign but they are the reason, I couldn't give a full five stars here. Number 1: The chicken they use in the stir fry is TERRIBLE. It tastes boiled and is just plain bad. However, I do usually go around 4:00 so maybe it is precooked and by the time I get there it doesn't heat up well. I honestly, don't know what causes it, but it's true. Number 2: I canNOT stand the acoustics in this place. I know it's supposed to be trendy and that's the whole thing. However, I would love to stay here after I eat and grab a shake or something but you can't even here yourself think because every sound is magnified. Again, this is also not the end of the world and it probably wouldn't bother me if I hadn't tried to do some homework here before. It was a bummer though because I wanted this to me my place to hang out before school.

So, in short: awesome stir-fry. order it to go. get the veggie, steak, shrimp or pork as your protein choice. i would suggest trying to add the sesame seeds some time because they make everything better. rice noodles are delicious. get a salad bowl with your stir fry because sometimes it is very hard to eat straight out of the standard box it gets served in.

When I saw the shrimp (more like prawns)--I was astonished.  Then when I looked at a fried oyster that was so lightly breaded you could see the details of it through the batter.   Add to that a homemade tartar sauce with the perfect amount of dill, and even an ice cold fried leftover was delectable.   It didn't even compare to Mandina's on Canal St.

The food can only get better when fishermen start going from boat to market in Lafitte.  

Once I was working on grand isle and a man asked a mini-mart clerk ""where's the fishing dock?""  She said ""there is no dock, they (boat) 40 minutes to the seafood market on hwy 90 in westwego!, that's where all the seafood goes.....""

Lafitte is building a seafood market where you can unload your boat and move your catch 50 ft. To a stand.  Westwego is building a new seafood market on the other side of hwy 90 in ""historic salaville.""

1,"I would actually say 3 1/2.
Wish this place was still BYO, but things change.
It always helps when you serve Sarcone's bread, and certainly you will not leave here wanting more. The portions are very large, the calamari was enough for 2 or maybe 3.
It came out hot, not greasy or chewy. The salads are also large, but the dressing was a bit much for my taste.
The pasta was cooked al dente, and the veal was tender. Sauces for both dishes were spicy and plentiful.
That being said, there are a couple drawbacks to this place. IF the weather permits, you are much better sitting outside, since its crowded and quite loud inside. While the food is above an average Italian restaurant, it seemed like they lay on the cheese and sauces a bit heavy.
Yes, it's nice they give you a Lemoncello shot after dinner, and the service was friendly, even though they were crowded. I would say the pasta at Avalon a few blocks away is superior, but overall Lemoncello is good and especially for families.","Friendly service, games to play and food was ok.

1,"Ok, aYUP it is ok.

We have been a few times now.

Friendly folks, but know nothing of service. No matter what we have ever had to drink a refill was never offered.... well not quite true, we were offered a refill as we were paying the bill today. I had coffee and water, the coffee should be advertised as the slowest drip coffee in the west, and apparently only one cup was brewed. Water too must be in short supply. Also iced tea ordered by the others ran dry and they do not bring a large glass full to begin with. 

The food is good, thus being ok. Last time we got tacos there was a salad on the plate, today nothing but the tacos. They had a nice flavour but not quite as robust as before.  The other food was fine in its flavour. 

We sat outside today, man what a depressing setting. That place needs some imagination and care to make it a pleasant experience. The inside of the building is small but pleasant enough. 

I hope this place does well but it truly needs to step up its game in service and consistency of food. 

So yeah it is ok as it sits, but my home kitchen is ok too.

Looking at the pictures I see what we ordered and see it is not what we got.","My brother in law is insane, no really he is. He will not eat anything unless he knows it comes from whole food. Now if that is not insane I don't know what is.

So we have been to this store a lot, sometimes just to buy one item to get the bag to fill it with cheaper stuff. I told you he was insane.

But at first I hated this place since I too am a bit insane and can not stand crowds of folks in small spaces and this place seems really small with tons of folks acting like it is a museum and just staring at the products that they have never seen before.

So we have been ;lucky in finding the store at times not too overly crowded and I can relax and shop, and when this happens I find some interesting products and great veggies and fruits along with some great cheese, even though they do not carry my favourite cheese, that being stinking bishop. Non the less I have found I do actually enjoy the store even when there are too many over processed folks shopping along side of me.

Oh but one time when looking at the cheese a female employee asked me if they she could help. I asked if the have any beer case cheese, now I realize it is a German cheese but have never heard it pronounced any differently than how I asked for it. So she asked me again and I said once again the same thing, she very haughtily said with a pointed finger, the beer cases are over there, of course pointing to the actual cases of beer. I then said no I am referring to the German pungent cheese. And then she once again in her best bitch voice said oh you mean and then pronounced it in the proper German. She of course knew what I was asking all along and it took ever bit of self control on my part to not crawl over the cheese counter and slam her head against the wall. 

Yeah but I still like the place.","Text1: Ok, aYUP it is ok.

We sat outside today, man what a depressing setting. That place needs some imagination and care to make it a pleasant experience. The inside of the building is small but pleasant enough. 

I hope this place does well but it truly needs to step up its game in service and consistency of food. 

So yeah it is ok as it sits, but my home kitchen is ok too.

Looking at the pictures I see what we ordered and see it is not what we got. 

 Text2: My brother in law is insane, no really he is. He will not eat anything unless he knows it comes from whole food. Now if that is not insane I don't know what is.

So we have been to this store a lot, sometimes just to buy one item to get the bag to fill it with cheaper stuff. I told you he was insane.

But at first I hated this place since I too am a bit insane and can not stand crowds of folks in small spaces and this place seems really small with tons of folks acting like it is a museum and just staring at the products that they have never seen before.

So we have been ;lucky in finding the store at times not too overly crowded and I can relax and shop, and when this happens I find some interesting products and great veggies and fruits along with some great cheese, even though they do not carry my favourite cheese, that being stinking bishop. Non the less I have found I do actually enjoy the store even when there are too many over processed folks shopping along side of me.

Oh but one time when looking at the cheese a female employee asked me if they she could help. I asked if the have any beer case cheese, now I realize it is a German cheese but have never heard it pronounced any differently than how I asked for it. So she asked me again and I said once again the same thing, she very haughtily said with a pointed finger, the beer cases are over there, of course pointing to the actual cases of beer. I then said no I am referring to the German pungent cheese. And then she once again in her best bitch voice said oh you mean and then pronounced it in the proper German. She of course knew what I was asking all along and it took ever bit of self control on my part to not crawl over the cheese counter and slam her head against the wall. 

Yeah but I still like the place.",yes
1,"While en route to see a friend perform at the Raven Lounge, I decided to pick up some sushi to go since said bar does not serve food.  The place itself is small, but the atmosphere is great for lunch or early dinner if you have time to sit down and eat there.  They also offer a special if you buy two or three rolls from the same list.  Their special rolls are great too--I had the American Dream roll (which had mango on the outside with spicy salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and tobiko (tiny fish roe)) and a regular shrimp tempura roll.  I will definitely come back again when I have time to eat in!","Came here for the first time on a relatively quiet Sunday afternoon for an early dinner , and I enjoyed every minute and every bite.  The waitress was super friendly and attentive, but more importantly, I REALLY enjoyed my sushi.  After much deliberation, I settled on the Cosmo Roll (sweet potato tempura and crabstick tempura) and a shrimp tempura roll.  Definitely worth it, and I'd love to bring a group of friends or my family here sometime--the atmosphere and menu selections are great for all!","Text1: While en route to see a friend perform at the Raven Lounge, I decided to pick up some sushi to go since said bar does not serve food.

Service was friendly and efficient. The decor adorable.

Keep it up, Prep!","My husband and I, recently, had a rather comical experience here! I am not a huge advocate of fast food, but we passed Wendy's and decided a couple of frosties would hit the spot. The inside of the restaurant was dead; there wasn't one single person inside, but we still decided to go through the drive thru. We pulled up to order and no one said a thing. We waited and waited, saying ""Hello?"" into the box and there was no response. After waiting for nearly five minutes, we pulled up to the first window. We could see one employee, but there back was turned to us and they were far enough away to not hear us talking, so we pulled up to the second window and there was still no one. At this point in time, I am telling my husband we should just forget the frosties and go. All of a sudden, a woman appears, frantically putting on her headset. She apologized and was nice but it didn't exactly make up for our waiting time or the fact, that NO ONE was even around to do their job. There wasn't even a person wearing their headset. Now, I could understand this if, lets say, they were actually busy, but we were the only customers they had. It took her and another employee about five minutes to get our frosties and then they didn't give us spoons or straws. We asked the gentleman, who was working, for both and he just walked away. Eventually, the lady noticed we were still at the window and helped us out with our straws and spoons. I was bewildered by this whole experience; all my husband and I could do was laugh! The service might not have been up to parr, but thank you, Wendy's for the good laugh!","Text1: Yum! Came with a group for breakfast on a weekday. I had the sweet potato hash. Mmmmmmmm.

Coworkers do almost nothing but scan your card when you come in, but they don't even do that sometimes.

Doesn't look easy to grab a bench so that's one reason I stick with the machines.

Parking lot remains unchanged.  People speed through the drive aisles and there is usually spit on the ground.  What is it with this place?  You have to hock loogies on the ground when you get in or out of your car?!

First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. ""This place would make a great business"" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.  We had the livery which is more of the standard and the carriage house which is more Texas, which is understating it because both are made with more than average ingredients.  Both were fantastic drinks! Upon being seated we were served some house made chicharones that were a nice crisp accented with a lime flavor that went well with our margaritas. I'm going to skip to the dessert because it blew us away!  The apple flan is a bit of culinary genius.  The texture was a silky smooth bit of creamy perfection served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side with a little garnish of a sweet cooked apple slice topped with I believe candied Marcona almonds. Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  They are making their desserts in house, and that includes the freaking ice cream.  I can't wait to see what kind of ice cream concoctions they come up with.  It's not my intention to take away from the small plates because we were not disappointed with our choices.  We shared the ceviche and the chicken empanadas.  Both were flavorful and delicious to the last bits. Lastly, Michael, Lee, and Phillip were all so very friendly and took the time to speak with us throughout our visit.

1,We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday.  We order meat pelmeni and veggie pelmeni.  These are a Russian version of tortellini.  Both versions were excellent.,"Definitely one of the best meals I have had in St. Louis.

First of all, the place clearly proclaims that it is a bar.  it is a bar in the center of the room with some tables around the perimeter of the room  But it is a bar with fabulous food, because all the food is cooked in Tony's kitchen.  

The servers act as both bartenders and waiters, and it is intriguing to watch them work the room.  It is old world service, without the stuffiness of Tony's.

My dinner: a wonderful tomato and watermelon salad, ziti with rock shrimp, chocolate coconut tart.  All of it superb.

Note that the place is inside the United Missouri Bank Building.  You enter from the lobby, not from the outside.","Text1: We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday.  We order meat pelmeni and veggie pelmeni.  These are a Russian version of tortellini.  Both versions were excellent.

0,Great bar!  Their hot wings are among the best in the area!  I would go there just for the wings.  The only problem is that you can still smoke in there but that is a good point for some people.  Beer selection is decent and their service is really good.  I tend to rate bars like this based on comfort level.  Bucket feels like home!,"I predict this to be the next, greatest casual Asian eatery of the bay.

Across from the busy Park Plaza, Season's sits in a small, unassuming plaza. The décor is rather plain... the menu and items for sale are straightforward--totally reminds me of the little Asian cafes in Southern California. Me likey. Small tables for groups of four and lounging areas for chatting.

Honestly--I haven't gotten anything besides the banh mi and shaved ice... and always on the go. But do you need more? Right now the banh mi is on sale for $2! Oooh that crunchy and soft contradiction of a bread housing the pickled veggies and shaved meats. You can taste each ingredient yet it all works in harmony. The shaved ice is light, fluffy snow with lots of variations on toppings. There's always some special to get a free cup of it.

The menu is a collection of Asian fusion: Boba, designer wedding cakes, phad thai, spring rolls, baked goods, and probably a pony ride too if you ask.

It always feels like the staff is wanting me to create familial conversation with them. They're cool. 

Due to its central location and awesome weekend hours (closed at 2am?) plus the ability to just run in and out,  I will be haunting this place more in the future.","Text1: Great bar!

Also, I agree with many others that it's a great place for people watching. I remember when it was Gallo Clothing... ecghk! This is a much better use of this space.

 Text2: This is a cool place to meet up with someone be it for a chat, a date, or even to hatch a scheme. Short of kungfu showdowns, I'm not socialized into the coffee/tea house culture so I don't know if I would really hang out here, but it's great in small doses. I tend to gorge on my raw tea at home. Also, I agree with many others that it's a great place for people watching. I remember when it was Gallo Clothing... ecghk! This is a much better use of this space.

So what about the tea? Ok check it out... I've been here twice and on each occasion something like 3 out of 4 of the teas I wanted were ""unavailable."" Eh. The teas I did have were fine... 1 bubble (I forget) and 1 hot (moroccan mint). One thing I think this place could stand to benefit from would be a bottle of liquid sugar or simple mixer syrup. Some shops buy it ready made and some just make it from scratch. It's a game changer! You can just drip and dip (Philly slang meaning: ""to leave"").

Overall, it's a great alternative to Starbucks/Cosi/AuBonPricey/Saxby's etc.",yes

It felt like there was an overwhelming number of sandwiches to try. While I like sandwiches they're very filling very fast. The second thing - it seemed like there was a lot of pork. Again, I love pork and all but I would have loved some exciting non-pork options. And last criticism - how am I supposed to try every truck if the portions are so big? I would have killed for half-size things at an event like this so everyone could have gotten my business. All in all it's a really nice event though and I wouldn't hesitate to go to another one.","Basic Spice is a nice, cozy place located in the South Grand area.  The staff are extremely friendly.  We even received a free order of spring rolls, which was nice.  The dumplings were also quite delicious.  

I am a coconut milk and curry fan and went for the Gang Dang (w/chicken), which was chocked full of various veggies and very tasty.  They also actually ask what heat level you prefer as far as the curry is concerned, which is an added plus considering some establishments do not.  The prices are a little steep but quality makes up for the added cost.  I will return to try another delicious curry entree in the near future!","Text1: I got to sample from a bunch of different places and I noticed two things, well, three things that were sort of strange/could be changed.

This thing was pricey, and we had decided not to put a real centre stone in it right away to save money for our honey moon. I went in to Michael Hill one day to scope out bands because I had never been in before. I was greeted immediately and asked if I needed anything. I explained what I was looking for, and she directed me to the appropriate areas. She complimented my ring, and asked if she could see it. I held up my hand, and she said it looked like it needed cleaning. I was aware, and she offered to do it. I was going to take it to my usual jeweler, Crowley's, but I figured why not? When she brought it back, it didn't look any cleaner, and she said, ""The side stones are very nice, but were you aware the centre is fake?"" I was appalled. Did she just take my ring to investigate my stones? I stiffly replied that yes, I knew, and that there was nothing there I liked, which was the truth. It's an average store, with another branch in WEM just like it. Not recommended.","Awesome, clean and straight up, bring cash and enjoy!","Text1: When I was planning my previous wedding, I was looking for a wedding band to match my custom Tacori engagement ring.

 The food was eggs, bacon, toast, a sausage link, home fries and oj, for $7.99.
Bacon and sausae crispy,  eggs cooked correctly, toat still warm & buttered.  The OJ was yart, can't quite explain that one anf potatoes lacked any real flavor and were mushy
Our waiter fas quite entertaining and wide awake. The orders were correct and for the price quite good. It appears to be a local hot spot for all meals and happy hour. I will be back to try other meals & Happy Hour.
Very enjoyable establishment.","I've been here on a few different occasions on various weekends. It's a nice alternative to world of beer next door for those who prefer liquor drinks. The place is nicely decorated and has a hip look, but its always packed since its so small. They never had any drink specials that have impressed me.

When I see that hot pink truck, I start jumping like a little kid and I get so excited!! I will wait in the longest line for this Mac, I don't care! It's that good. 

The BBQ chicken Mac is my favorite so far, but they always change the flavors so you can always try something new! I love that! I recently had the spinach & artichoke Mac, that was killer also. All the special combo macs are better than their 7 cheese original, IMO.  so try something fancy!  The Mac is so creamy and rich, that's what I love. You hardly taste the noodles cause the cheese and other toppings are so rich.. That's how you make Mac!! It should be so creamy that it sticks to the roof of your mouth.. Yes! Mac mart does it right!! 

I got 2 of my friends hooked on it already, who's never had it before. They love it too! And the staff working the truck are so friendly they rock. 

Can't wait for the next night market so I can eat this creamy cheesy amazing goodness all over again! MAC MART!!! Don't change a thing, you guys are amazing.","First time here last year, I ordered a sub to go.  Worst decision ever.  The bread was soggy and the sandwich was just horrible.  I vowed never to go here again.  Fast forward to yesterday, I went again.  Order a sub to eat in the store.  Perfection!

I was greeted immediately when I walked in, the cashier was ready for me to place my order right away, I didn't feel pressured to ""super size"" my sub or to add the combo.  The sandwiches can be ordered fully loaded with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard... or you can pick and choose what toppings to add.  The sub was then steamed and served directly to my table with perfectly melted cheese.  If you opt for the drink, there is one of those newer Coca-Cola machines that allows you to pick and choose any drink/syrup combination known to man.

While I was eating, a lady stopped in to place a large order for pick up this weekend.  The manager was super polite and explained the options in detail.  She was even able to customize the order by having the lettuce on the side instead of the sandwiches being prepared with the lettuce on them.  Mustard and mayo packets come on the side.

Moral of the story: don't order the hot sub to go, eat in the store.","Text1: I've had Mac Mart now 3 times. Once last year, and twice this year (so far) at the different Night Markets throughout the city. I love this Mac so freakin much, I have to write a review now!!

1,"This review is only for the tall hurricane I had at Willie's, and not for the food, as I haven't had their food. On every block on Bourbon St, you can find a damn Willie's Chicken Shack. It did not help my sense of direction down there at all. Rather than go back and forth looking for a good place to grab a hurricane, my cousin and I opted to get one at Willie's. Here are my thoughts...

I liked the $15 price tag for a huge, collectible tall cup (you know the one that's synonymous with Bourbon St at this point) of hurricane. And I like that there was a good variety of different daiquiri flavors to choose from and/or mix. But, when it comes to the strength of my drink, I would suggest opting for another location or adding (several) shots of alcohol to kick it up a notch.

The flavor of my traditional hurricane slushy was good, but I felt like it was barely any stronger than what you find at a 7/11 slushy machine. I'm not going to lie though, I drunk it down fast, and it, mixed with the other liquor in my system from dinner that evening, did give me a buzz. I'm just saying I have reason to believe that another hurricane/daiquiri purveyor on Bourbon may have given me something a bit more potent. IJS.","Thank you Trops for not dismissing STL altogether after the last location closed. The grove is the perfect place for you to be and this location is awesome! 

I came here last Saturday with a friend and the place was jumping! Sadly because of the rain, the patio wasn't open, but even still, the place is huge with lots of seating. The variety of slushies here is great, just like the one in COMO. You can also mix the flavors to make your own boozy delight. The prices aren't bad either. The small is $5 and is definitely enough. The service by the barkeeps is also great.

One day soon I'll come back and try the Guerrilla Street Food and enjoy the patio.

The sweet potato fries are SO GOOD. I really like being able to get sweet potato fries without having to spend more money at a normal restaurant. I would just get multiple orders of them as a meal if that were socially acceptable...

Other than that, I've had the Bistro Bella. That is really good as well. I did, however, find that the olive tapenade overpowered the whole sandwich. Maybe they just put too much on or I'm too sensitive to the flavor, but when I ignored the olive tapenade, it was really good. Probably wouldn't get again or would request for them to use an extremely small amount of olive tapenade.","I came back because my friend wanted to come here for lunch.

It was pretty good, in a ""cheesesteak from the pizza place down the street"" kind of way.

She let me try one of the fried ""shrimp"" that fell out. The breading was very tasty, but the ""shrimp"" tasted similar to that of what you'd find in a grocery store ramen noodles with fake shrimp package.

My favorite is the pork soondoobu (I think a new addition), but I also love the seafood, mushroom, and kimchi soondubu as well. The banchan (little side dishes) are always great - the cucumber kimchi! They keep raising the prices, but I don't blame them. I will gladly pay 11$ for a bowl of their soondubu, rice, and side dishes. 

 Text2: They were extremely helpful when we walked in. We weren't familiar with the 'case only' rule that PA has (so no 6 packs unfortunately). They actually walked over to tell us, when we were wondering about it aloud, which I appreciated. Their cold room is ridiculously cold and I refused to step in - my friend went in for me. I guess that's good for cold, refreshing beer! We ended up with left hand variety pack, and the cashier guy struck up a nice conversation about how there's a beer with my last name. Ended up with some great recommendations for next time. 5 stars for great service and the arctic cold room.",yes

I got here expecting to be able to do a little singing and jamming. It wasn't late at all, but I was told that they were done with Karaoke for the night. Bummer. It was a decent crowd, although it was kind of packed. People seemed friendly enough and the bartenders had a nice beer selection and were fast despite the crowd.

I would love to go back and actually sing some karaoke. Hopefully I will find myself in the area again, soon.","The experience is seriously hampered by the limited seating. If you need to sit next to an overweight person (which would seem to describe ALL their regulars) you will pretty much need to turn sideways.

The Red Beans and Rice were superb.  Lots of Andouille, and a perfect ration of rice to beans and gravy.  Also has the crispy mac and cheese (which the sign said contained crawfish, but was apparently out of date.  They change the dish every week, and don;t seem to care to update the simple computer-printed sign.   Food is prepped to order and arrives piping hot.  Mac and cheese was lightly breaded and DEEP FRIED (which might explain the girth of the regulars.) 

In all, very authentic NOLA-style cuisine, and friendly and efficient service.  It would have been more pleasant with a table and without a dozen people behind us eyeing our seats.","Text1: I wish I could give a more thorough review of Kajun's, but I really can't.

0,"My experience at Sbraga last night made me very happy.  I would like to see this restaurant succeed and thrive and I believe it has the potential.

As I entered the restaurant I could tell that the renovations and new layout worked very nicely.  The bar is off to the left and it seems that they have their ""quick-fire"" kitchen out in the open so you can see the kitchen staff hard at work.  Nice touch.

We all went for the tasting menu and it is a value.  For my first course, I went with the truffled chicken caesar salad.  While this may seem like a very safe bet I can assure you that the homemade dressing had the zing of anchovies and they spared no expense on the insane amount of truffle on the chicken.  I did get a taste of the sweetbreads which where quite crispy and delicious.

Second course, fish and chips.  Oh my God.  These were just ridiculously good.  The fish was fried perfectly (aka, light, not oily) and the few chips were cooked nicely as well.  What made this dish stand out was the use of curry in both the batter and sauce and thinly sliced jalapeno.  It just made it delectable.  Really, you've gotta try them.

Third was the lamb belly with an avocado puree.  It was delicious and I expected it to be that way.  The plate was highly artistic and very rich in flavor.  The portion size was also substantial.

Finally, a cheese plate for dessert.  There was an american camembert and another cheese which I don't recall.  It was awesome.  Great portion size and with a Central Waters Pale Ale, my palette and my stomach were happy.

Food, decor, service, this place really shines.  I can't wait to return.  It's the perfect pre-theater meal.","Absolutely terrible delivery experience. First off, the delivery person called me, the recipient, to complain about how he could not ""fit me into his schedule."" He ranted for nearly 5 minutes while I was still at work. I tried to politely inform him that I was the gift recipient and perhaps he should inform the sender instead. He cut me off and continued talking about how the company usually doesn't do any deliveries after 5pm despite being able to schedule this time with the company beforehand. I ended the phone call flustered and having pushed my time to 4:15pm to suit the needs of this delivery person.

Hearing of my situation, the gift sender complained to management who responded that they do, in fact, deliver after 5pm. Surprise, surprise. This employee was simply trying to get off work early. When the package finally arrived, the fruit was fine, but...let's talk about the balloon.

This was the saddest balloon I have ever seen in my life. It sings, but it was COMPLETELY deflated, despite the delivery person's assurance that it was simply due to the cold. No. This balloon had a hole in it. I photographed it for Yelp and for my own dry humor.

 We moved here a handful of years ago. We would walk around, hang outside. Bring our laptops, browse around the shops, eat at Grillsmith. 

Mocha, our doggie won a most cutest dog contest at the Halloween contest for two years(Thanks for the $50 gift cards we would win!)

My fave stores here are Charming Charlies, Bath & Body Works, Pottery Barn, Bare Minerals, and Macys.

I also love Grillsmith and Primebar, and they also have Cantina Laredo (go for happy hour), 100 Montaditos, Pinchers, and Brass Tap.

While the shrimp themselves were tasty, there weren't enough of them so I was left with a big hunk of terrible bread, lettuce, pickles, and some bad tomatoes.

1,"Woah.  Jack Patrick's in the running for some of the best burgers in town?  Gotta disagree.  This place has a fun atmosphere and would be a big deal nestled next to campus in College Town, USA.  As it's located in Downtown, however, the feeling's a bit different.  It was reasonably hopping on a weekend night, and something tells me it gets nice and crowded when it needs to.

Don't come out of your way for a burger, though.  Ours took forever to arrive, there was way too much bun in the package, and they were vaguely reminiscent of bowling alley burgers.  The fries upped the average, though.  Still, with a sub-$7.00 pricetag, though, if this place was downstairs, I might be singing a different tune...

Lots to do here: pool, whatever they call that scaled-down shuffleboard bar game, arcade games, a nice long bar.  It'd be a fun place to hit up with a bunch of friends for a party.  I didn't get a drink, but the bartenders seemed knowledgable.

Will probably be a while before I'm back here -- it was a burger contingency after the Tap Room announced an hour's wait for a seat -- but I have a feeling Jack Patrick's won't let me down when I return.

(Logistical note: no real table service, no carryout. Order food at the window, drinks at the bar.)","First impression:

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?","Text1: Woah.  Jack Patrick's in the running for some of the best burgers in town?  Gotta disagree.

Upon walking in, this bar manages to be a perfect mix of comfortable and sexy. The atmosphere makes me want to sit down and have some drinks. Perfect. My only wish is that the bar was bigger. It gets crammed and I think they should take one stool out.

The cocktails are delicious though I've been stuck on the Framboise. It's some bubbly with fresh lemon juice and a raspberry liquor. Its refreshing but not too sweet. It's subtle. I love it. Other than that, they have something for everyone from what I can tell. The bartenders are inviting and know how to mix a cocktail paying attention to every little detail. They have also been helpful for suggestions which is great. 

I will absolutely continue to come back to this place. I only worry that once the word is out, it will get jammed packed as it's pretty small.","I was thrilled to find myself near HipCityVedge right before the lunch rush the other day. I'm a lady who loves her meat AND veggies so I've been eager to give this place a try. 

I walked into a small, clean, friendly store and went with the Crispy Ranch Chick'n Burger. Delicious. It came out, hot, crispy and covered in this delicious ranch sauce. I loved it. I loved every bite. Yes, it was pricey for a sandwich but it was absolutely delicious. 

I'm really looking forward to the next time I find myself in the neighborhood at lunch time!","Text1: I was beyond thrilled when I heard about Emmanuelle coming to the piazza.

I must say, it's nice to be able to watch a movie without audience participation and also get parking.

- hawaiian burger

Was only going to get a grilled cheese sandwich, but my check-in via Yelp gave me a free soup so I went ahead and cashed in on it right there and then.

Spicy here is spicy... be careful... but definitely enjoyed the spicy fish. We also did the fried wontons, good but nothing crazy special, and a rice noodle dish with pork. All was delicious. There were six in our party and the bill was 42 bucks. We brought a couple bottles of wine and after tip had a great authentic dinner for under 10 bucks each.

Most importantly the service was great.  Accomodating the two vegetarians in our group was only possible with the waiters help. They also were able to seat us, as they asked another party of three to move to a smaller table so two tables could be put together.

0,"Is it true?  A great place to eat sushi in the Northwest?  No way!  Yes, yes way.  And of course I discover it the same week I get an offer on my home in Northwest Reno.

So, here is the skinny.

This place is actually surprisingly good.  The service was AWESOME!!  I had a party of 12 show up and they bent over backwards to take care of us.  Special requests were taken care of promptly.  Friendly as heck too.

Atmosphere is pretty standard Reno AYCE sushi.  Think Sushi Time or Sushi Pier.  It's not a fancy ""date"" place.  The roll presentation isn't all ""ooh ah"" so if you eat more with your eyes than with your mouth.  You may be disappointed.

However the food was really good.  The flavors were full and the rolls seemed to actually taste different between each roll.  You know how many times you go to a place and it just seems to be the same roll with the same sauce with different names...this wasn't the case here.

One roll I really liked was the ""red"" roll.  Just wows I tell ya.  Wows!

I will be going back, even though I don't live up there anymore...I will be going back.  With friends.  And you should too.

They sat our party without a wait (there were probably about 15 or 16 of us), and we got a long table with a great view of the street.  This place has a modern, clean decor and friendly wait staff.  The food is also really good.  I had a really good burger and a huge, cold pint of beer.

This place also delivers, caters, and hosts parties.  It's also good to just hang out at their bar, and they have happy hour specials on a regular basis.

0,Momos has great service and good food with decent prices. There's also belly dancing most nights during the week! The menu has lots of variety so there are lots of options to choose from. The lamb kebobs are good. The shrimp and grits is also very good. The chocolate phyllo dessert is ok but a little too crunchy for my taste.  The chocolate creme brule' is very rich and delicious.,"So, I hate to be a nay-sayer in the homogeneous list of 5-star reviews, but at this point, I find Village Whiskey just ""A-OK"".  That's not a bad thing, but I was decidedly underwhelmed.  I had been hearing the burger raves for months, but had also heard about the 2-hour waits.  I had been waiting for just the perfect occasion, and it came on a random Wednesday afternoon at 3:30 while entertaining an out of town friend.  

Garces has done a very nice job with the space, and has achieved a classy, old-school bar vibe.  The tiles and woodwork are beautifully restored, the mirrors are antiqued to perfection, most of the light fixtures are charming.  In light of how-well designed everything else seemed to be, the cheap white metal fluorescent fixtures above the bar with label glue still staining them stood out like sore thumbs.  But I digress . . .

We claimed a primo table by the bar and set out to enjoy the ""best burger in Philly"".  Our waiter was very friendly, helpful with beer selections, and solicitous without being intrusive.  My friend went with the burger as described on the menu; I added cheddar.  We split an order of duck fat fries and washed it all down with beer.  To get right down to business, the burgers (both ordered medium) were good.  They were so good that I did not even mind paying $10 for them.  However, they were NOT the best burgers in Philly.  Both were slightly overcoooked, and the meat, while juicy, would have benefited from a bit more salt or seasoning.  If I had waited 2 hours for the experience, I would have been right pissed.  The duck fat fries were very good - crunchy on the outside, redolent with duck fat flavor, and filled with fluffy potato-y goodness.  Though the order looked on the small side, they were rich enough that the two of us could not finish them.

I expect I will be back to Village Whiskey.  I really dug the vibe, and I saw some intriguing cocktails being prepped with tender-loving-care at the bar.  I was entranced by the shaving of limes and muddling of herbs.  Speaking of cocktails, I ordinarily loves me some whiskey and the list at Village was pretty spectacular.  It makes it all the more sad that I will probably not be having any of them there.  The mark-ups were fairly ridiculous, especially since good whiskey does not really require any Iron Chef magic.","Text1: Momos has great service and good food with decent prices.

0,"Well we came here because Yelp listed it in the best seafood search engine. What a misleading search result. They have only 4 fish choices. We had Duck and Chicken instead. 
Appetizer of stuffed mushrooms was disappointingly bland bread stuffing. The Duck was a rubbery half breast with a tasty blackberry sauce. But way too much pepper seasoning as was the half mashed potatoes: wild rice would be a better pairing. The broccoli and carrot side was the best part. Chicken dish was ok. 
The chocolate creme brûlée was exceptional good, highly recommend.  
The atmosphere is nice, a little shabby but not offensive. 
Service was friendly and attentive. 
We had one glass of wine and an $80 bill seemed high for the quality.","This place was seriously delicious! My boyfriend and I decided to come here to celebrate after I took a big exam and it was well worth it. 

We got there around 2 after a horrible time at the DMV and were warmly greeted by the host, who sat us almost immediately. Once we sat down we both already knew what we wanted: a burger with all the trimmings, and top it with some onions, cheddar and bacon please! We also ordered the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce.

After placing our orders our waiter quickly brought us our drinks: I got the philadelphia punch which was apricot brandy and tea,, with some other delightful ingredients. And my boyfriend got an old fashioned. His was a lot stronger than mine by definition, but I was so pleased with both of our drinks. Mine was sweet but not overwhelming, and his was tart and smacks you in the face with some liqour. Exactly what we both wanted.

Once our burgers came we both dove right in. You have to flatten your burger cause it's such a fat patty. I stupidly ate the bread first and saved the burger for last cause in my mine, I'm thinking, ""save the best for last!"" But I was so full I had a couple bites left of delicious meat on my plate. Burgers were juicy and the carmelized onions were sweet and a perfect compliment to the bacon. 

The duck fat fries with the cheese sauce were also perfect! Just the right amount of salt and thickness to the fries, and the cheese sauce was like magic.

Little known tip for the future customer: eat the bread side last, and make sure you have plenty of napkins. You'll be having burger juice run down your chin and not feel bad about it.","Text1: Well we came here because Yelp listed it in the best seafood search engine. What a misleading search result.

1,"Love love love Kate! This place is under new mgmt so if you haven't been here in years give them a shot, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I came here a few times years ago to see a stylist i liked and it felt so ""old lady-esq"" that I stopped coming, my stylist left and of course they won't tell you where they went. The only remaining stylist from the prior ownership is Chris and she's such a great asset to this salon. So now I have Kate's # so now she's mine forever lol

Recently I was gifted for my birthday to get a keratin treatment on my hair and after calling around local shops I settled on 9 West Main and boy oh boy am I glad I did. 

My stylist, Kate, is awesome. Super friendly, social and welcoming. Today was my second keratin treatment, takes 2 hours but is so so worth it! I also get my roots covered every month-6 weeks and it's so affordable I don't have to suffer with gray roots for 2 months like I used to. My average based on my hair growth is every 5 weeks. Keratin every 3 months. 

They do both mens and womens cuts here. It's always to best make an appointment here but they service walk-ins as well. I can't say anything more than they are spectacular. Give them a try!

Cut and color = $85
Keratin = $150

The salon i used prior was $120 for cut and color.","Kate's still my girl but since i had to push back my appointment this afternoon and Kate's getting ready for her bachelorette party this weekend, Kara took me on without hesitation in between her clients! 

The 3 girls are so great, super nice and really good hair stylists. You can have any conversation with them and they really make you feel like they care and are listening bcuz they ask questions. 

Sarah has cut hubs hair in the past and she's great at men's cuts.

I also get my roots covered every month-6 weeks and it's so affordable I don't have to suffer with gray roots for 2 months like I used to. My average based on my hair growth is every 5 weeks. Keratin every 3 months. 

They do both mens and womens cuts here. It's always to best make an appointment here but they service walk-ins as well. I can't say anything more than they are spectacular. Give them a try!

Cut and color = $85
Keratin = $150

The salon i used prior was $120 for cut and color. 

 Text2: Kate's still my girl but since i had to push back my appointment this afternoon and Kate's getting ready for her bachelorette party this weekend, Kara took me on without hesitation in between her clients! 

The 3 girls are so great, super nice and really good hair stylists. You can have any conversation with them and they really make you feel like they care and are listening bcuz they ask questions. 

Sarah has cut hubs hair in the past and she's great at men's cuts. 

My schedule today was ridiculously tight and they accommodated me by making room for me. Super thankful!",yes
1,"I feel sort of torn about the Comcast Center Market. It was such a good idea, but it ended up being a watered down version of Philly favorites when you can get the original just a few blocks away. I like Under the C on occasion for their crabcake sandwich, but they used to have these yummy crab fries that came with the meal that they've replaced with a less tasty version. sad.
DiBruno brothers seems like a waste to me, just walk to the original one three blocks up on Chestnut. 
Termini brothers is too heavy for lunch, so I have yet to find an excuse to actually use this stand.
And the list goes on...
Great idea, just not well executed.","I needed an escape from the fast paced Philadelphia (which i love so much) and found it in Kanella. Decorated in the typical Santorini decor, Kanella feels like you've left the city far behind.  Authentic but inventive food, it's difficult to decide on just one app and entree. The servers here seem to be in love with their job; listening to them describe the specials makes your mouth water.

This was a little hole-in-the-wall with a tiny menu when they first opened. Since then, they have spruced up the decor and expanded their menu. And the food, which was delicious on day one, has seriously improved. The al pastor pork is consistently the best I've eaten, and the other meat options are equally good. I usually go for tacos and keep it simple, while Boyfriend has fallen in food love with the sopes. I really need to come here more often and try some other things on the menu.

You can easily get a filling meal for two for under $20, which includes a little basket of nachos topped with beans and cheese, and two amazing salsas. Service isn't super friendly, but they get the job done and the food is delicious so I'm not going to complain.","I have been coming here since 2010 when I lived in Fishtown then I moved to South Philadelphia so I figured that I might as well join a gym closer to home plus I got a new puppy. After a few months at Bally's I was so disappointed that I decided to return to City Fitness. Now, I couldn't be happier and I go to the gym more often. The equipments are in great shape, the facility is air conditioned and clean. The locker is a little small but that's not a deal breaker for me. The staffs are very nice and helpful. Parking can be a little tricky but if you live or work in the area just walk there. I'm just so glad that I came back and I was surprised by all the improvements when I came back.","Text1: Always 5 stars for delicious food I can get without having to walk too far from my house.

0,"Absolutely terrible delivery experience. First off, the delivery person called me, the recipient, to complain about how he could not ""fit me into his schedule."" He ranted for nearly 5 minutes while I was still at work. I tried to politely inform him that I was the gift recipient and perhaps he should inform the sender instead. He cut me off and continued talking about how the company usually doesn't do any deliveries after 5pm despite being able to schedule this time with the company beforehand. I ended the phone call flustered and having pushed my time to 4:15pm to suit the needs of this delivery person.

Hearing of my situation, the gift sender complained to management who responded that they do, in fact, deliver after 5pm. Surprise, surprise. This employee was simply trying to get off work early. When the package finally arrived, the fruit was fine, but...let's talk about the balloon.

This was the saddest balloon I have ever seen in my life. It sings, but it was COMPLETELY deflated, despite the delivery person's assurance that it was simply due to the cold. No. This balloon had a hole in it. I photographed it for Yelp and for my own dry humor. 

Never again. I'll make my own chocolate-covered strawberries, thank you.","Thanks to Erin M I am addicted to their burritos!

The reason I go here is for the produce. Their produce is excellent and extremely cheap, similar in price to a farmer's market but much better quality. I always go here for parsley which is $0.52 a bunch as opposed to $1.10 at the normal supermarket, just to give you an idea of price differences.

Ted Drewes WISHES it could be as good as Mr. Wizard's. Yeah, I said it. 

I hoofed it over to Mr. Wizard's tonight for some pre-race fuel. What, no one else scarfs down custard the day before a half-marathon? 

I wanted to keep things simple, so I went with a vanilla Oreo concrete. No frills, no bells and whistles. Just plain vanilla custard with tons of oreo chunks mixed in. 

My order was ready before I could shove my wallet back in my purse. Speedy! 

And...oh my...this, my friends, is what custard is supposed to taste like. No soupy mess that melts in 10 seconds. No flavorless custard that NEEDS toppings mixed in to taste like anything. 

This is the real deal. Creamy, rich, flavorful custard that refuses to melt right away. I turned my cup upside down, just for kicks. It didn't budge. Sweet. I noticed that Ted Drewes doesn't even bother to do that anymore when they serve it to you. I wonder why...

Anyway, back to Mr. Wizard's. They offer a ton of mix-ins, and if you're into specialty concretes, they offer those as well. They also serve sno cones, and if you're really weird...errr...daring, they offer sno cones with custard mixed in? I don't get it. 

Anyway, this spot is the real deal. Ted Drewes comparisons aside, this custard spot stands on it's own.","I hate it when I am initially thrilled with a restaurant, only to have subsequent visits disappoint me. Such is the case with Tasty Tom's. I have had the steak and eggs again recently, and found the steak to be a poor cut of meat, full of fat and gristle. On the most recent visit, I ordered a vegetarian omelette without cheese - it arrived full of cheese. Fortunately, it was quickly replaced, but if I did like cheese I would have been disappointed, as it appeared to be processed cheese-like substance. And on the other side of the table was steak and eggs yet again - except the steak was over-sooked. It was replaced, and the same problem was repeated - too brown, through and through. And those potatoes I first raved about? Under-seasoned and under-cooked.

Word to the wise - this place packs up on the weekends and during dining under the stars, so make sure you make reservations!  I've also been told that there is an opera night that sounds pretty interesting, so I'd like to check that out sometime.

Most recently, my BF got the Kentucky Hot Brown, which is not really a sandwich, but more of a delicious cast iron skillet full of delicious cheese sauce, turkey, and some sort of bread that is like a pancake, but not soggy.  I may have to defect from ordering my burger and switch over to that next time.  

Drinks are pricey, but well worth it.  The bee charmer is my favorite drink on the menu - I've never seen another like it in my drinking career (lavender/chamomile infused gin, yellow chartreuse, lemon, & honey).  If you're a fan of whiskey/bourbon/rye/scotch, this place is for you!

My biggest complaint about the Village Whiskey in Philadelphia is that it's REALLY small inside, so if you have a big party (like 5+), don't even bother.  Even a party of three is usually squished in to a little table.  You'll have more luck getting a (comfortable) seat if it's nice and you can sit outside.

1,"We have started including La Monarca in our Sunday lunch rotation.  Most recently we have enjoyed some good tortas that were very large and filling.  I had mine al pastor and Ms T had pollo.  Both were very good, well seasoned and dressed.

We love their salsas and chips which are served warm.  The salsas are unique.  The red is very well flavored with red chile and loaded with garlic.  The green is loaded with fresh jalapeno flavor and although it has a little tomatillo, is not tart as you would expect.  These break away from the predictable tomato versions.

We eat light for lunch and the plate two tacos works well.  On our most recent visit, I had the saudero (grilled pork).  It was a little dry, but cubed small and seasoned.  It is obviously pre-cooked and then grilled to crisp it up.  It has a nice crispy texture.  Ms T had pollo again, but this time on a huarache.  The huarache is fried and is crisp but a little hard to eat.  Never the less, this is very genuine Mexican food.

We are now regulars.","We selected Home Wine Kitchen for New Year's Eve for dining with the D's.  Since New Year's Eve was on Monday, it coincided with a fixed price ""No Menu Monday"".  Since I like places with smaller menus and daily specials, this worked out well.  The server interviewed us for likes and dislikes and allergies and then brought us what the Chef selected for us.

I will avoid minute details on the meals since they are not items you will always be able to order, but hitting the highlights we were served the following:

Appetizers: Seared Scallops; Pan Fried Chicken Livers; Black Eyed Pea Falafel and Grilled Artichoke
All were good, well executed and creative without being silly.  Ms T received the scallops which were excellent.  Mr D's Chicken Livers were beautiful, large, light colored and mild.  They were clearly not the small, dark red bitter ones that are commercially available in supermarkets.  My Falafel were accompanied by a nice spicy habanero-pineapple marmalade.

Our main courses were; Grilled Pork Tenderloin, Bone-in Veal Chop, Chicken Risotto and Grilled Pork Chop.  Again these were the work of a good chef.  My Pork Chop was properly done medium rare and served with a white bean ragout.  Ms T's Grilled Pork Tenderloin was even better (better grill flavors and seasoning), but a little too rare for her.  I loved it.  Mr D's Veal Chop was very large and he declared it to be excellent.  Ms D loved here risotto.

Also included were desserts.  We actually traded them around a little to better match up preferences.  We had a great meal.  The No Menu thing is a little tricky.  Unless you have done it before or have anticipated telling someone your likes and dislikes, this is not as easy as it sounds.  You think you have told them the things that you don't eat (for me that is a pretty short list) but for example, Ms T forgot to tell them no rare meat or bread pudding.  Regardless, she found plenty of pork that was done enough and as a bonus, I got the rest.  The portions are generous.

I can highly recommend Home Wine Kitchen.  I suggest trying it on a normal menu night and then going for the No Menu Monday.  For some reason, I struggle with the name of this place.

1,"First off I want to give kudos to all the amazing people that volunteer their time at Telus World Of Science :-) The place looks immaculate and you would be hard pressed to find somebody where if you stopped them to ask a question they wouldn't  have an answer for you.

With that being said however I just got back from my first visit to the Telus since they brought in this new concept of upcharging admission for their ""feature exhibits"" and I have to say I was really disappointed with the experience. We walked through the whole body works exhibit reading 90% of the informational plaques on the cases and walls in half an hour and I really don't feel that it justified adding an extra $10.00 to the price of the general admission.

There is two exhibits at the Telus ""Mystery Avenue"" and ""The Body Fantastic"" that have been there a number of years and when you walk through them you really feel that they have outlived their usefulness. Body Fantastic has a number of things in it that look worn out and need maintenance and Mystery Avenue amusingly enough has video footage with news personalities that haven't been on television in quite some time. I think it is also worth mentioning that the explorer gallery upstairs is currently sitting empty without an exhibit.

There are a number of great shows in the Imax right now and thankfully a healthy offering of 8 different shows playing in the Margaret Zeidler star theatre. The star theatre shows are included in the price of general admission and definetly worth a look.

It's a great place to take kids for fun and interactive learning but just not a venue in th city that promotes repeat visits I think. If the city was smart it would put some money into the Telus to breathe new life into it and stop spending money on stupid sculptures to put on the corner of Fox Drive and the Whytemud but that will never happen until we get rid of Stephen ""WE NEED A NEW ARENA"" Mandel.",Sand on Whyte is the sister exhibit to the Ice on Whyte event that runs during the winter time. If you take it for what it is which is a fun summer time stop while walking Whyte it is actually quite nice and very worthy of my three star rating. There were about eight completed sculptures when I visited today and one that looked like it wasn't quite finished yet. The creativity and talent that goes into making these huge detailed pieces out of sand is more than worth the admission by donation cost. There was also a sandbox set up for kids to play in and a raffle for a dinner at Chianti's up for grabs here. Is it the Fringe or street performers? No...but for the price of a cup of Starbucks it will get you and your family out of the house for the day and leave the kids with a neat story to add to their list of summer time 2016 memories.,"Text1: First off I want to give kudos to all the amazing people that volunteer their time at Telus World Of Science :-) The place looks immaculate and you would be hard pressed to find somebody where if you stopped them to ask a question they wouldn't  have an answer for you.

With that being said however I just got back from my first visit to the Telus since they brought in this new concept of upcharging admission for their ""feature exhibits"" and I have to say I was really disappointed with the experience. We walked through the whole body works exhibit reading 90% of the informational plaques on the cases and walls in half an hour and I really don't feel that it justified adding an extra $10.00 to the price of the general admission.

There is two exhibits at the Telus ""Mystery Avenue"" and ""The Body Fantastic"" that have been there a number of years and when you walk through them you really feel that they have outlived their usefulness. Body Fantastic has a number of things in it that look worn out and need maintenance and Mystery Avenue amusingly enough has video footage with news personalities that haven't been on television in quite some time.

0,"I love St Pete Beach. So do Stingrays. So make sure you do the Stingray Shuffle! The sand is soft on your feet and easy for them to hide in. Often times I have been here and dark cloud in the water approaches the beach. Tourists come screaming out of the water while locals run to it to try to keep the rays from landing. As long as you don't step on them, we can all live happily together but it is just easier to not have to worry about stepping on them. Sit quietly in the water and you might have one land at your feet. This absolutely excites me, I love being a native Floridian and have a lot of respect for my wildlife neighbors. Disclaimer : Its probably not best to try and pet a Stingray if your not sure how. Maybe visit the petting tank at the Florida aquarium before you try it in the wild. 

Another great thing about the St Pete...it is a long beach so even if it is crowded where you parked, or near your hotel, a walk down the beach will yield a less crowded place to land. 

Parking can be hard to find if you are not staying in one of the hotels on the beach. Because of this, the restaurants have to impose fees for parking until you produce a receipt that proves you were a customer.

It is family oriented and quite touristy. It is built up with a lot of hotels, restaurants and shops but that gives you a lot to do if you are here on vacation.","We made the biggest Valentine's faux pas which is, deciding last minute to go out for Valentine's Day. Luckily thanks to the Open Table app, we were able to secure a reservation Saturday night for a peak hour seating. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside as it is housed in a large, commercial style building, but the inside is fresh, brightly lit and minimally decorated. 
I award three stars for the experience, as service was friendly, accommodating, timely and food was executed to the best of their ability. Where I found it lacking, was taste and temperature, general atmosphere. Too picky?
We ordered the Blue Crab Dip with Parmesan Cream for our first course, second the Cream of Mushroom Soup and Complimentary Salad for the Special Entree, and Entrees were Eggplant Vincent and the Fish of the Day, Redfish, served whole with potatoes and vegetable of the day. 
The soup was served first, and was under seasoned and not very hot. Crab Dip came next and though gooey, bubbly and tasty, was slightly overshadowed by the pools of oil on top. 
The entrees were also good, my boyfriend loved the simplicity of his fish and it was cooked correctly. My Eggplant Vincent was  a cup of eggplant breaded and fried and stuffed with crab and shrimp, served over a butter cream sauce and angel hair. Again, slightly under seasoned, but over all a good, tasty dish.
Overall, not my pick for a romantic evening or food to write home about, but suitable for an affordable, seafood orientated craving.","Text1: I love St Pete Beach. So do Stingrays.

0,"This review is based on their lunch special sushi deal. While is IS a great 'deal', as the old adage says: you get what you pay for.  Three rolls plus soup or salad for $12.00, sounds good right? Well it is except they skimp on the fish and the rolls are on the small side. The sushi is still tasty, which keeps me coming back, but sometimes I wonder just how much of a 'deal' I'm getting.  I have ordered take out from here numerous times because I like the deal and in a crunch sushi craving, it fits the bill. 

However, they aren't consistent.  Sometimes the rolls are prepared perfectly with enough fish to not make you question why you ordered from here, and other times, my roll is falling apart and I'm wondering how my Alaskan roll found its way to me sans salmon. Did I order a veggie roll? No. Just have to ""Where's Waldo"" your salmon sometimes? Gotcha. Lastly, delivery has taken upwards of an hour sometimes during lunch rushes. Make sure you eat a granola bar before you order.

I won't two star them because the fish is still fresh and is satisfying, but had to three star because there are so many sushi spots in the area that deserve the 4 and 5 star spots.","It pains me to give this place a 3-star review because I wanted to love it so much, but there were just a few things that needed work for this place to be amazing...

I came here with 3 friends on a cold, snowy night. It was pretty packed so we had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table, but it was not a big deal because we were at least out of the cold. The restaurant itself is small and can't seat more than 30 or so people, so expect a wait if you come at peak dinner times.

They have a lot of good options on the menu, and one friend and I decided to split the eggplant and cheese pizza. My two other friends split the margherita. When the pizzas were brought to our table, I noticed that the crust of both was visibly burnt. I guess that's what you get with wood-fired pizzas, but I didn't really appreciate the burnt taste while eating my pizza crust. Other than the crust, our eggplant pizza was delicious, and my other friends enjoyed the margherita. The pizzas, though, were also smaller than I expected. And even though I ate 3 pieces (which is half a pizza), I actually left hungry. Maybe I need to order one for myself next time. Also, it was kind of annoying that one of the pizzas came out several minutes before the other. Of course, I understand that they don't want the pizza to get cold, but it was kind of awkward that my friends were half done with their pizza before we started eating.

My biggest problem with Pizzeria Vetri was that we felt like we were being pushed out at the end of our meal. As I said before, the space is very small, but I do not believe that gives the servers the right to try to hustle people out immediately after they finish eating. My friends and I had taken over an hour to order, eat, and catch up over dinner. We continued to chat for a while after we had finished because that was the point of meeting up for dinner. We were sitting at a long table that was shared with other guests, and the couple who had been sitting next to us left. A server then put a bunch of silverware tat the table where they were sitting to indicate that a large party was coming and that they were waiting for us to get up to seat them. We continued talking, and a few minutes later, that server then took our water glasses away from us. At that point, we knew they wanted us out, but we stayed a little longer to finish our conversation. I did not appreciate feeling hurried to leave, and if space continues to be an issue, it would be better to expand the place rather than to have customers feel rushed, because they just might not come back!","Text1: This review is based on their lunch special sushi deal.

1,"I love the concept of this place. One half of it a café that serves different types of coffees and teas, and breakfast type items, and the other world where it serves bar type apps, salads, and sandwiches,  Can't forget that they also serve a wide variety of beers that they serve on tap, bottled, or in can.  

This place is pretty darn casual, and one can hang out here for hours with their friends.  Reminds me of the good ol' college days when no time could pass especially on a chill out Sunday Fun day.

Bring your four legged friend too.  They are totally welcome.","I came back on a much quieter Sunday afternoon to pick up some birthday cookies for my sweet friend Melony!

The guy helping me was super nice and helpful! I tried a rainbow cookie and some cremes they use, and picked out some wonderful goodies. Rainbow cookies and a black and white cookie is what I picked!

This bakery is adorable and I love how they are local. They grew up in New York and the guy that helped me use to pick up these cookies on the way to school when he was young. 

The desserts are so so good. They also make customized cakes. They also have pre-made cakes that you can come in and request they decorate for you. 

So happy to finally have a fresh local bakery in the area!","Text1: I love the concept of this place.

1,"A lot bigger than their South Street and Piazza stores, which is an awesome thing. There is now more room to find bigger pieces, such as furniture and signs. The prices are more reasonable than flea markets these days, so you do not have to worry about breaking the bank. If you're looking for vintage/retro antiques then this is the place to go.","I came on Saturday in the afternoon and enjoyed my time there. The staff was friendly and willing to chat with you. They have a decent draft and bottle list. I ordered the Dante Piccante burger and it was spicy, but delicious!

1,Definitely wanted to check this place out for a long time after hearing how it was basically a house tucked into the quiet Navarre neighborhood. The bar was fairly quiet the week night we walked in. There were a few friendly faces around the bar and a fairly nice bartender behind it. The place warmed up a bit when someone threw a dollar bill into the digital jukebox. The thing that stick out the most was that the bartender tallied each order in a notebook rather than a point of of sale system. Old school and quirky. I'm down.,"This is one of my favorite shops. This place is packed, and there is always something interesting to find since the inventory constantly changes. My Elvis whiskey decanter is a fav. Lots of hats, purses, jewelry, and everything else in-between. Super friendly folks too. Check them out and discover some unique finds.","Text1: Definitely wanted to check this place out for a long time after hearing how it was basically a house tucked into the quiet Navarre neighborhood.

1,"Finally, I got a chance to make it Federal Street Donuts!  I have been hearing about this place for some time now though various media coverage.   I did not arrive there until 2pm in the afternoon, which led to anticipation and anxiety.  Both of these emotions were from hoping they were open, not sold out of donuts or Fried Chicken, and hoping that the line would not be too long.   They were sold out of their Fancy donuts, but they had plenty of their Hot Fresh donuts, which come in three flavors: Appollonia, Indian Cinnamon, and Vanilla-Lavender.  I was super geeked that they still had chicken.   

I ordered each flavor of the Hot Fresh donuts and I ordered a half of chicken, which consist of a breast split in half, one drumstick, and one thigh.  You have the option of putting a dry rub or a wet rub on your chicken.  Torn between the dry rub and the wet rub, I went with my first inclination and ordered the harrissa dry rub. 

On the surface, chicken and donuts seem like an odd combination, but they pair together well, just like chicken and waffles.   The fried chicken is Korean-style, which made it super crunchy, and the donuts were warm and delicious.  I can see why this place is so popular.  They serve up donuts and chicken that is different from the norm.","Wow!!! What a fantastic Italian restaurant!  I really like the atmosphere of this place.  Because the space for this restaurant is small, the noise level can be very loud.  I know this might bother some people, but it is fine with me.  I think this extenuates the atmosphere and adds some excitement.   

We arrived on a Monday night and the place was packed.  There were four of us in my group and we were told it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait.  Within 10 minutes, they had us seated at our table.  The restaurant occupies the space of two row homes.  Seating is very tight.  During the nice weather months, they do have outdoor seating.  

They have an extensive wine by the glass menu.  I ordered chicken lemoncello which came with two pieces of chicken that where served caprese style along with cappellini pasta, lump crabmeat, asparagus, and a lemon and white wine sauces.  OMG! My meal was delicious!  The lemon and wine sauce that was on the chicken and pasta was dazzling.  I wanted to lick my plate to make sure no sauce was left behind.  I also had a chance to try their ricotta gnocchi with crumbled pork sausage, broccoli rabe, and cherry tomatoes.  This dish was good also!  

Our server was very attentive.  She even recognized we had a sleepy toddler with us and it was time to get the check.  I really like this place!","Text1: Finally, I got a chance to make it Federal Street Donuts!  I have been hearing about this place for some time now though various media coverage.

I love having the big boy platter or some Brunswick stew, but my go to food is a full rack of ribs with cole slaw and fried okra! Southern heaven in the plate. You know it's going to be great just after you walk in and are hit with the beautiful aroma of smoke and pork. Try anything and you won't be disappointed, just make sure you slather it in their delicious sauce!!!","New update: place still sucks.  Only real good thing is the price.

Coworkers do almost nothing but scan your card when you come in, but they don't even do that sometimes.

A decent number of people still don't wipe down the machines.

In the 30-min circuit area, people just sit and use the machines instead of doing the circuit.  I had some lady get annoyed with me when I was doing the circuit and she had to sit on her machine instead of allowing me one set.

Doesn't look easy to grab a bench so that's one reason I stick with the machines.

Parking lot remains unchanged.  People speed through the drive aisles and there is usually spit on the ground.  What is it with this place?  You have to hock loogies on the ground when you get in or out of your car?!

I almost skip my workout so I don't have to come here.  I just got an offer from another gym...hmm.","Text1: Having grown up nearby to Alex's this is the BBQ I judge most BBQ against.

The salt and pepper jumbo shrimp and mei fun are also solid.  The mei fun comes with plenty of protein and egg.  The prices are definitely much more reasonable and the $8.50 lunch specials are fantastic.  A portion will easily last 2 meals, and the food is served very quickly.  It's also close enough to campus that a 1 hour student-faculty lunch is completely feasible.","Decent food with private karaoke rooms upstairs.  The dishes were solid save for the fried chicken, which was definitely sinewy and subpar.  The fried rice with minced dried shrimp was very good, as was the shrimp toast.  Actually, the shrimp toast was amazing with the lightest, crispiest shell!  Portions are pretty generous, as well, except for perhaps the fried jumbo shrimp in a honey walnut cream sauce.

1,"Three cheers for Herbie's! 

I visited here a few months ago with a friend. The place itself is pretty nice; there's definitely a French theme going on there. 

Our server was initially a little standoffish and pretentious; I'm not going to lie. I was not a fan of the service at first. But something -- either the fact that I whipped out my DSLR and started snapping pictures or the fact that we weren't punk kids -- changed, and he became a lot friendlier as the evening went on. 

I started with their Sage N Stormy drink -- dark rum, apple spice ginger liquor, simple syrup, lime, and sage made up this delicious drink. I guzzled it down and had to go for a second. Yeah...it was that kind of night, y'all. 

Food-wise, I went with the lobster mac & cheese. I recommend going with the smaller portion, because I opted for the larger one (fatty, fatty, two-by-four...) and it was WAY too much food. 

Oh, but it was so good. Rich, creamy, FULL of huge lobster chunks, topped with crispy breadcrumbs...it was heaven in a bowl. 

My friend ordered the peppercorn & coriander encrusted yellowfin tuna. It was served with an edamame and shiitake mushroom risotto, tempura bok choy, and a wasabi soy sauce. I had a few bites and it was pretty good, although I enjoyed my mac & cheese more. 

For dessert, I went with (what else?) their bread pudding. I honestly wasn't a fan of this; it was made of some sort of hard french croissant, which made eating it sort of challenging. The ice cream that accompanied it was almost bitter, and the stingy drizzle of chocolate sauce did nothing for the dish. Meh. 

The waiter also brought out a chocolate fritter on the house for us to try. Again, I think this had more to do with the fact that I had a camera in my hand than anything else. But I'll take it! 

This, my friends? This fritter was delicious. It was a crisp outer shell with the richest, most sinful dark chocolate inside. I could have eaten ten of these. Thank goodness he only gave us one. I have no self control.

All in all, it was a good experience. Would I come back to Herbie's? Sure. I'm in no rush to return, but the food was good, and once our server warmed up to us, the service wasn't too shabby either.","I came here for the latest installment of the International Supper Club. The company was fabulous, and the food was even better! 

I ordered #24, the Khao Pad Sriracha. Hello -- anything with Sriracha in its name HAS to be a winner, right? 

It consisted of fried rice, green onions, broccoli, onions, egg, and thai hot chili sauce. It was very heavy on the onions (I'd ask for no onions next time), but other than that, it was DELICIOUS. The whole time I was eating, I kept saying ""this is so STINKIN good!"" over and over in my head. Wow. And it definitely had a kick. Sriracha is no joke! My nose was running like crazy. Sexy.

Service was a little crazy, but I won't judge since there were about 30 of us. :)

The only thing I wasn't a fan of? The thai iced tea. The first few sips were good, but I couldn't down much more than that -- it's SUPER rich. It felt like I was drinking a glass of half and half! 

I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.","Text1: Three cheers for Herbie's! 

I visited here a few months ago with a friend. The place itself is pretty nice; there's definitely a French theme going on there. 

Our server was initially a little standoffish and pretentious; I'm not going to lie. I was not a fan of the service at first. But something -- either the fact that I whipped out my DSLR and started snapping pictures or the fact that we weren't punk kids -- changed, and he became a lot friendlier as the evening went on. 

I started with their Sage N Stormy drink -- dark rum, apple spice ginger liquor, simple syrup, lime, and sage made up this delicious drink. I guzzled it down and had to go for a second. Yeah...it was that kind of night, y'all.

I was expecting to walk in and smell steaks from the front door but instead I smelled Lobster. It could have been the tank of live lobsters at the entrance :)

The food was amazing. The Steak House salad was good. The steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The Mashed potatos were creamy. I had Warm Bread pudding for dessert and that was amazing as well. I was happy with the Restaurant week menu choices. Better than other places I've tried. 

The only complaint I do have is about the seating arrangements. We were seating in what seemed to me as the lobby/waiting area. We never actually stepped foot inside the real restaurant. As soon as you enter there are two rooms on each side of you. Then you walk up to the Maitre'd. Behind him/her is the rest of the restaurant but we were seated on the left side in the entrance. I was disappointed. It was crammed with people. I felt the tables were to close to each other and too close to the wall. 

A bit of soft music would have been nice too. But I'll definitely go here agian. Maybe I'll try the one in KOP so I wont have to pay for parking!","Text1: Was late and hungry...

1,It's basically a mini-mall of upscale national small retail stores (but there is Brown Betty cupcakes located down one of the corridors) and a food court.

0,"I was thrilled to find myself near HipCityVedge right before the lunch rush the other day. I'm a lady who loves her meat AND veggies so I've been eager to give this place a try. 

I walked into a small, clean, friendly store and went with the Crispy Ranch Chick'n Burger. Delicious. It came out, hot, crispy and covered in this delicious ranch sauce. I loved it. I loved every bite. Yes, it was pricey for a sandwich but it was absolutely delicious. 

I'm really looking forward to the next time I find myself in the neighborhood at lunch time!","Methinks we just had a bad night, a really bad night.

The boyfriend and I went to Sage earlier this summer for a romantic little dinner for two. The patio was lovely. Weather was ideal. Not a mosquito in sight!

We ordered cocktails. I was in the mood for a dirty, Grey Goose martini. The boy had a mixed drink... probably gin and tonic. His drink came out okay, my martini was green. I apologized to the server. I explained myself. I bartend. I drink, a lot. My martini really shouldn't be this salty or this shade. He apologized and took it back. After quite sometime (I am in the industry... I understand, shit happens) he came back and explained that the very last of the Grey Goose was used in my martini and asked if I would like another brand. Of course, I didn't care what liquor was used, but it dawned on me that the bartender was initially short on Grey Goose, and tried to cover it up with olive juice. Who does that?

Appetizers and side salads were delicious.

Entrees come out. I have pasta with blue cheese. It's rich and I love it. Boyfriend cuts in to his medium-rare steak to find it cooked medium- well.  We share my pasta while waiting for the server to check up on us.

He never returns.

When we're done eating and drinks are empty, here resurfaces our lovely waiter. We tell him about the steak and he apologizes and takes it away. 

The rest of the story IS NOT A JOKE. This really happened.

A minute later the chef comes out to our table, with the steak in a cardboard box, and asks us if we'd like to take the steak home. We tell him that we're not really interested in eating a medium-well done steak, and prefer it to be medium-rare to rare. It is at this point that he tell us that we are incorrect; the steak is medium-rare. Then he opens the box and shows us the steak, cut in half, grey in the middle. ""See, it's definitely  pink."" 

We say not a word. We couldn't. We were so dumbfounded. I suppose, since we're in our mid-20's, he thought he could pull a fast one. Or, maybe he thought we would believe him.... or maybe he was high on crack. I'm not sure. I will never forget this experience. EVER. Seriously, who does this guy think he's dealing with?

I'll go back someday, I suppose. But only if the chef is long gone. Or, if he writes me a formal letter apologizing for his shenanigans, which were all a terrible side effect of his medication that he is no longer taking.","Text1: I was thrilled to find myself near HipCityVedge right before the lunch rush the other day.

0,"Hubby and I love living in Franklin, and while we don't live in Westhaven, we frequent this neighborhood for the great little Chinese place next door.  This past weekend we noticed a new neighbor to our stir fry haunt, and had to pop in. 

It seems they only opened two weeks ago, and Hi Brow is a coffee place, a pastry place, and an ice cream place as well.  It's a small little shop, but the coffee aroma triples its square footage if the front doors are propped open like they were on the night we visited.

We enter the front door and see this HUGE farmhouse type table with this amazing chandelier and glass domed cake stands, wire baskets of pastries, and random other goodies with comfy benches to prop up a seat.  On one side there's a cooler with chilled beverages, and at the back there is a small ice cream freezer sporting about eight flavors and a helpful, smiling barista.

We had just eaten and of course were not hungry at all, which means I got ice cream.  I picked a buttery caramel traditional cream based something or another flavor, and it was yummy.  It was rich, way rich, I could tell I've been on pinkberry for a while now... a nice little treat.

A plus for some would be that they serve you ice cream in a cup with a wooden spoon, felt like a balsa wood or something.  I'm all for saving the planet, and I get that plastic is practically forever, but I gotta say the sensation of that wooden spoon in your mouth with ice cream... not a fan.  It was just weird.

Will we stop back in another day?  I'm sure we will.  And I'll opt for a cone, and probably pick a less rich flavor for my palate, but cute nonetheless.

The barista/ice cream scooper lady said the name Hi Brow comes from the name of the farm the owners also own.  And if you're thinking that huge neon sign is just an HB and not Hi Brow, you'd be right.  Signage isn't big here, but in a community like Westhaven, that's OK.  Cute place, independently owned, stop in for a visit.","Fabulous store.  Lots of cute clothing and toys, all mixed up boutique style.  Lolli Lolli is the perfect place to buy a baby gift.  They have it all, and the SA's are super helpful.

Minus one star because there are 5-6 steps at the entrance to the store, making it impossible to browse if you have a stroller with you.  Hello!  Mom's always have strollers.  I bet they're turing away tons of would be browsers!","Text1: Hubby and I love living in Franklin, and while we don't live in Westhaven, we frequent this neighborhood for the great little Chinese place next door.

We stop in the tiny sandwich shop and were greeted by a friendly staff person. There are only a few tables inside, but a good amount out doors. I got a sausage parmesan sandwich because that sounded so satisfying. The sandwich was delicious and it was nice to sit outside on a sunny say while enjoying our food. This is a great lunch spot with awesome sandwiches!","I was first introduced to El Camino when I met a group of friends there one evening. The food is exceptional for a bar, and I like the large open seating area and low lighting. There is also a bunch of outside seating, but I can't comment on it as I've never eaten outside here.

My favorite menu items here are the fried pickle chips (corn-meal batter gives it a really nice texture), the brisket sandwhich (on buttered texas toast/can sometimes be fatty), and the ribs! The ribs are done in a Texas style, great dry rub, smoked in-house, and no sauce. The bark on these suckers is delicious, smoky, and a little spicy, and the meat falls right off the bone. It was so good, I don't even remember if it came with a side, who cares? 

Also, if you are having a late weeknight, the margaritas are half-price on weekdays after 10PM. That's a pitcher (about 4 glasses) for 10 dollars. They are done in a traditional style, non-blended, and served on the rocks. Yum! I actually prefer them this way. You can get salt or sugar on your glass, but I like it straight up, nothing on the glass.

If you're going to visit El Camino I suggest a weekday as it seems to get very crowded on the weekends. I can't say for sure, but usually crowded places in this area get obnoxious really fast.","Text1: This is an awesome little lunch spot my fiance and I just discovered!

I get my pepperoni pizza and leave. Personally I was not a fan of this pizza. The sauce is almost too sweet and then it has like a pepper taste that doesn't work well with it. The only part of the pizza I liked was the crust. It was very light and fluffy.

The store was packed with crowds of people looking for their next great find, but for the most part I was unimpressed. Most of their prices could rival a consignment shop, although they have days where they offer 1/3 off the tagged price.

Still, if you look close enough, you might find that hot pair of last season's D&G boots or costume hat with feathers for next year's Mardi Gras celebration. And you might be lucky enough to snag that hat for under $5 on a sale day.","Text1: I stopped in today to redeem my free large 1-topping pizza from T-Mobile Tuesday.

They had most of your standard breakfast foods. I got an eggs Benedict, and it was what you would expect. Location close to Rittenhouse is great, and the atmosphere is lively. However, there's nothing particularly exciting. Will possibly include this place in my weekend brunch rotation list.","I wanted to like this place sooo badly! Thai Mexican fusion? Food truck? Sounded so awesome!! Unfortunately, the food was below my expectations. (Or my expectations were just too high, having just spent last weekend, and years before, in California and all).

I got the 3 taco deal ($8 for 3, or else it's $3 each). I ordered 2 shortribs and 1 chicken. I'm glad I got two of the shortribs b/c they were by far better (maybe just personal taste). It was a sweet glazed BBQ flavor, yum! Only problem was that the beef was too tough, wayyy overcooked. The flavor made up for it. The chicken was a curry satay flavor, not so sure how I feel about it in a taco.

The soft taco shells were so-so, nothing special, but not bad, probably store bought. The semi spicy mayonnaise was pretty tasty though!

I also ordered mango ""tea"", which is a slight misnomer. It's more of a really sweet yogurt (condensed milk?) drink... So something like a mango lassi, no tea in it. For $2, it's not bad, but they reAlly should call it something else! Add 50cents to add boba to your drink.

So why 4 stars when I thought the food was mediocre? Friendly service goes a long way, and they just seemed like really nice people. It also led me to discover a whole row of food trucks on Ludlow serving the Drexel community, which I otherwise wouldn't have known about, even though I pass by the area on my walk home every day! They have a few other items I still want to try. Will update as I make my way through the menu!","Text1: I came here for a weekend brunch, and it was packed!

Flat screen ordering and clean as can be.

I love WaWa but this one is truly the cream of the crop, as the saying goes.  It is HUGE too!  

I'm looking forward to go back, pathetic, I know but I love their coffee and joined PNC just b/c they're WaWa's ATM on hand and I'm always in here!","Predators game - Smashville - you love the atmosphere and Bridgestone is a great facility. Walking in through the Nissan atrium with ultra high windows. Numerous vendors on the ground level with prime items - Yazoo Beer, Nathan's Hot Dogs, and the usual arena food.

Pet peeve: 1 door for entry but usually all 10-12 doors are opening and operating so that is convenient. Saw an awesome funnel cake on the 100 level. When asking a vendor where I could get one, was told they are sold on the top level or someone might be walking around selling them on the lower levels.

Not sure if there are enough men's restrooms for this type of venue. Line was 5 deep per urinal during 1st intermission in 1 restroom. Spent most of the intermission in line.

If going for hockey, bring a jacket. Parts of the arena will have huge drafts while others are fine.","Text1: Brand new 'super' GORGEOUS WaWa.

0,"If you need to travel from Philly to anywhere else in the northeast corridor, 30th Street Station is where you need to be.  Do not get on a plane, do not get on a bus, and leave your car behind.  It will usually be cheaper, faster and more relaxing to ride those rails.

This magnificent train station reminds a girl what travel used to be like.  From the angel sculpture to the high windows to the old-school flip board showing the train times, this transit hub does the city proud - especially on the way into town.  The actual Amtrak platforms are kind of dark and dingey.  This makes it feel even more spectacular when you emerge into the architectural wonder above.  I can imagine someone making their first trip to this ""foreign"" town 100 years ago coming up those stairs and feeling pleased with their decision to visit.  30th St Stn is also where trains coming in across central PA need to switch over from diesel to electric engines, and this transition goes quickly and smoothly 99% of the time.

The amenities are sufficient, with lots of options for food and drinks at most hours that trains are running.  The bathrooms are reasonably clean for what they are - public transportation bathrooms, though some of the stalls are tiny.  These problems seems small when you can get an excellent shoe shine, a properly made latte and a bouquet flowers while you wait for your train.

The connections to local rail services (MFL and Regional Rail) are easy to utilize, but could be a little more clearly marked.  Furthermore, I am pretty sure that SEPTA gives the 30th St Stn assignment as a prize to their least grumpy representatives.","This has got to be the worst Burger King I've ever been to. The service was normal, for what it's worth, but the burgers and fries tasted like ass and the whole place was filthy. I dropped my scarf on the floor and caught Hep C just picking it up. The place was full of homeless people refilling soda cups from other stores and crackheads staring bug-eyed at their fries, but I guess those people gotta eat too.","Text1: If you need to travel from Philly to anywhere else in the northeast corridor, 30th Street Station is where you need to be.

1,"Bummer of an experience. The salad was uninspiring and the lamb was overdone and paired with mashed potatoes that were drowned in a salty gravy that reminded me of my mom's pot roast, not French fare. I had to choke it down.

I knew I was in for a poor experience when the bread came out soft and yellow, covered in salt and paired with...butter! I thought it was a wedge of cheese. Duh was I wrong. Americans...sigh.

I guess I'm doomed to lame bread until I can return to France again.

I will not be returning.","So sad my second time eating here was nothing like the first. Sandwich was bland and the vibe was the same. I felt like I was one of the herd at the school cafeteria.

I like being thanked for spending my time and money at a place, not made to feel like I'm asking someone to go out of there way to make me some lunch.

Don't just exchange food for money, be elated someone chose your place!

1,"I've often passed this swanky little place in Downtown filled with good-looking professionals laughing over drinks, appetizers and spilling over the sidewalk

NOM NOMS
Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow. 

SERVICE
Thanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a ""vegetable"" beer they offered--spot on. 

SUMMARY
I'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours. Cool, hip place to bring the girlfriends or if you're looking for impressive, gutsy art dishes with good taste.... and if you have cash to blow (but I won't let that subtract a review star)","I predict this to be the next, greatest casual Asian eatery of the bay.

Across from the busy Park Plaza, Season's sits in a small, unassuming plaza. The décor is rather plain... the menu and items for sale are straightforward--totally reminds me of the little Asian cafes in Southern California. Me likey. Small tables for groups of four and lounging areas for chatting.

Honestly--I haven't gotten anything besides the banh mi and shaved ice... and always on the go. But do you need more? Right now the banh mi is on sale for $2! Oooh that crunchy and soft contradiction of a bread housing the pickled veggies and shaved meats. You can taste each ingredient yet it all works in harmony. The shaved ice is light, fluffy snow with lots of variations on toppings. There's always some special to get a free cup of it.

The menu is a collection of Asian fusion: Boba, designer wedding cakes, phad thai, spring rolls, baked goods, and probably a pony ride too if you ask.

It always feels like the staff is wanting me to create familial conversation with them. They're cool. 

Due to its central location and awesome weekend hours (closed at 2am?) plus the ability to just run in and out,  I will be haunting this place more in the future.","Text1: I've often passed this swanky little place in Downtown filled with good-looking professionals laughing over drinks, appetizers and spilling over the sidewalk

0,"So awesome! This is such a fun time. For 2 hours, you can BYOB (there are limitations) and then make some photo op and bar stops along the way. Not sure where to stop? Then just leave the route up to the driver! 

There are 4 seats for nonpeddlers, but the peddling is half the fun!","I love the concept of this place - am always a fan of bringing ethnic cuisine to the fast casual sphere and executing it without sacrificing quality. I came here over the weekend, and clearly many others are in the same boat. It was packed but the line moved quickly. On top of that, our food arrived quickly and seating was still ample since the restaurant space is surprisingly large. 

As for what we actually ate there, we split:

+ Hummus w/ slow-roasted lamb - The meat & toppings mix was kind of funky and gamey tasting for some reason. Not as big of a fan as I am for Dizengoff's hummus & toppings. Suraya's hummus is also more neutral-tasting.

+ Shish taouk sandwich - stuffed with chicken, french fries, and some other stuff. Not bad, but wasn't super impressed compared to other Middle Eastern fare I've had in Philly.

+ Turmeric tea - very nice and liked the spices

The baked goods counter looked incredible, and I wanted to just sample a little of everything. In fact, I came close it and got a huge bag of pastries to go:

+ Cruller - one of the best I've had!
+ Flan patissier - this had Meyer lemon in it. Wasn't a huge fan, and comparable to other egg tarts I've had
+ Jalousie - not bad. Not as buttery or flavorful as I'd hoped
+ Chocolate pistachio (financier?) - same as above.

Again, I love the concept, the incredible design of the interior, etc. However when it came down to the food, I wasn't super impressed. In an area with tons of good restaurants, I still might take my friends to give this place another spin and because it's such an interesting space/food.","Text1: So awesome! This is such a fun time.

0,"The Breakfast & Lunch Nook opened three weeks ago in what used to be called the Pita Hut in the Town and Country Shopping Center at Kietzke and Vassar.
It serves breakfast and lunch, both all hours it is open. It's a minimal menu serving diner food but they seem to do it well.
I tried it for breakfast today and got eggs, a hamburger patty, hash browns and a half order of biscuits and gravy. The hamburger patty was lean and well cooked, the eggs were eggs. The hash browns were the only part of the meal I didn't like. Kind of gooey and I didn't like the taste.
The biscuits and gravy were excellent, maybe the best in town. The gravy is obviously made from scratch with nice chunks of sausage and soft biscuits. 
The lunch menu is pretty simple as well. Open-faced sandwiches, hamburger or other sandwiches, salads. It's diner food done right.","For the longest time, I was madly curious about LUSH cosmetics.  I always read such raves about their various products, but had no direct access to LUSH (other than mail order) when I used to live in Houston.  
So LUSH is pretty darn awesome, as it turns out.  It's all handmade, a great deal of it vegan, bath products.
So that being said LUSH products are obviously pricier than your mass produced commercial bath products so don't walk into here expecting sales galore and deeply discounted deals.  It's really quite adorable the way all the different bath bombs, bath melts and etc. are shaped differently in colors, shapes, and sizes from one another - usually in way that corresponds with the product name or what it does.  The packaged face creams, shampoos, and whatnot come in black cartoons with the respective labels and directions.  I think they also include who actually made and packaged your product - nice personal touch!
That being said, I am really not that much of a bath product junkie!  I've tried Sex Bomb, Floating Island, Buffy the Backslayer, Coalface, and some other products - out of those, I only really loved Coalface, but didn't repurchase it after I ran out.  Maybe I'm just stuck in my was, but I rather prefer Sephora, or just plain ole Target for my beauty and bath needs.  
However, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these items for my friends.  They do smell wonderfully divine and I can see how people can get addicted to LUSH . . . it's just really doesn't really hardcore appeal to me, but it's really nice quality stuff!","Text1: The Breakfast & Lunch Nook opened three weeks ago in what used to be called the Pita Hut in the Town and Country Shopping Center at Kietzke and Vassar.

1,"I  came here for lunch one afternoon looking forward to trying it and left hungry because I lost my appetite mid meal and here is why: 

I unrolled my silverware and there was cheese encrusted all over the fork to where the prongs were not even visible. Ok, strike one but not the worst I've seen so lets just grab another fork and move on.  

I make my way over to the buffet which was fried chicken and red beans and rice and I've heard good things about it so I was looking forward to trying it. They had quasi clean plates stacked on top of buffet line so I grab one and notice that there is rice matted onto the plate. Hmm...their dish washer must have been texting and drying because the dirty dish theme continues. Strike 2. 

Fast forward to new plate, new fork and my party of six are all back seated. Then my neighboring friend turns to me and goes, ""is this what I think it is?"" Yep, an enormous dead bug chilling in the middle of his red beans and rice. Now, this was no ordinary bug, this bug might as well had a hat and coat on because he was a hefty sucker. Clearly, he died from red beans and rice overdose or as I like to call them, red beans and flies. Strike 3.

1,"I have a serious weakness for Culvers crinkle cut fries.  Pretty sure it's because they are fried with the rest of the offerings.  In any case, I love me a small order of fries with a vanilla custard concrete mixer.

One complaint about this location...they always have about five to six people working the counter and one or two people splitting time at drive thru and the labor intensive concrete/shakes.  And no one ever seems to help out even with no one else in line.  Other than that, the store is well maintained for a fast food operation and the kiddos and I enjoy coming here for the aforementioned treats.","I have been coming to Allisonville Nursery for many years now and continue to be impressed.  I have never purchased trees here but have purchased a wide variety of shrubs (boxwoods, hostas, ninebark, several viburnum varieties, etc.) and all are going very strong in my yard.

I've always been impressed with the quality of the plants here...although my father used to own a landscape business (and purchase wholesale) and I have a pretty good feel for prices.  I think some of it is a tad expensive.  Not too concerned though...I don't mind supporting local business and the store is just really cool.  None of the green peppers I purchased from here last year bore any fruit (similar plant from Home Depot same spot did fine), so that has been my only issue.

As others mentioned, there are a large selection of garden accents, pots, fertilizers, etc.  It really is a very comprehensive selection of products...and there are many items you won't find at a big box.

The staff is extremely helpful...today I was looking for a pedestal for a sundial and the staff went out of their way to assist me in what I was looking for.  I ended up leaving with a birdbath and Patty (?) spent a good amount of time helping...thank you!  It just is the sort of place for people who love gardening and the outdoors...impulse buying is very easy here.

Note of caution...in the spring on a weekend this place can get extremely crowded.  Getting assistance is definitely more an issue just due to volume. If you need help swing by during the week...they will take care of you.","Text1: I have a serious weakness for Culvers crinkle cut fries.

I think some of it is a tad expensive.  Not too concerned though...I don't mind supporting local business and the store is just really cool.  None of the green peppers I purchased from here last year bore any fruit (similar plant from Home Depot same spot did fine), so that has been my only issue.

As others mentioned, there are a large selection of garden accents, pots, fertilizers, etc.  It really is a very comprehensive selection of products...and there are many items you won't find at a big box.

The staff is extremely helpful...today I was looking for a pedestal for a sundial and the staff went out of their way to assist me in what I was looking for.  I ended up leaving with a birdbath and Patty (?) spent a good amount of time helping...thank you!  It just is the sort of place for people who love gardening and the outdoors...impulse buying is very easy here.

Note of caution...in the spring on a weekend this place can get extremely crowded.  Getting assistance is definitely more an issue just due to volume. If you need help swing by during the week...they will take care of you.",yes
0,"Decent quality food. Their vegetable and grain salad is my favorite.

Their burger is OK. Nothing terrible, nothing to write home about.

Fabulous service! I've ordered To Go here and on the premises and both times, they've been great.

I do want to go back to check out their Happy Hour/bar scene.","Fun place to go to catch up with friends! Pretty setting and have yet to be disappointed with food. A little pricey but the food always seems quality. Had the small goat cheese salad, tiny but ate up every single bit of it! Then shared cheesesteak egg rolls, served with a horseradish sauce that was mild and not too overpowering. Finished off with my favorite dessert! Warm Banana bread
Pudding! They took it off the menu for about 6 months but now it's back! 

Parking is tight. You can make reservations through yelp, the weekends get very busy so do it while you can! Valet available for 5 dollars but at catelli.","Text1: Decent quality food. Their vegetable and grain salad is my favorite.

1,"We were there on a weekday night. So the place was not crazily busy.  We picked up 4 plates from the belt and ordered other 4 from the menu. It was close to closing time so the chief wasn't going to add more plates on the circulation. The ordered dishes came out fast and fresh. The sushi and fried calamari all tasted good and they all matched their pictures shown on the menu. Our waiter did a good job serving us. He paid attentions and responded fast. The ambience was nice even in the middle of shopping mall. Our booth seats was comfortable. We tried 8 plates totally and the check was $35. Usually in a regular sushi restaurant, 35 only allowed us to have 2-3 different dishes or roll. The selections from the menu are huge, from fried rice, noodle to dessert. 
If everybody's new year resolution is to lose weight, eating smaller portion is the key. I don't mind paying less money for smaller , good quality food. It will be cool if Italian, Mexico, Mediterranean food, pizza, burger etc. all become small and fit in the small dishes that parade in front of the customers on a conveyor belt. Overall, this restaurant was better than I expected as a shopping mall food court place.","This was my first encounter with Guatemalan cuisine and they were wonderful. I was so surprised they tasted so different than any other Central or South American food. We had the delicious rosa drink and the extra fragrance made it different from  Caribbean version or Asian version of hibiscus drink.  The grill pork was delicious. The black bean has a really good flavor and the color was Pitch Black. There was a jar of pickle veget on the table. They tasted good and less spicy than I thought.  
The most fun part was the chatting with the friendly owner. His mom is the Chef cooking all that delicious food and bread and appetizer. She was too shy to have a picture with us.  We walked to the map  on the wall  and he pointed to us  the history, the culture, the tourism, the social issue about his country Guatemala. It was so educational. 
The shelves against the wall next room display grocery items. There were some interesting and unusual items. One of the excitement of being a Yelp member was Yelp always leads me to a new territory of the fun and educational experience.  This is a clean, good price, good food mom and son  restaurant. It was a treat so spend my afternoon here.","Text1: We were there on a weekday night. So the place was not crazily busy.  We picked up 4 plates from the belt and ordered other 4 from the menu.

0,"I was beyond thrilled when I heard about Emmanuelle coming to the piazza. I have always thought that Nolibs was in desperate need of a place to go and grab cocktails. When it comes to beer, you're covered but a cocktail place was lacking...until now. 

Upon walking in, this bar manages to be a perfect mix of comfortable and sexy. The atmosphere makes me want to sit down and have some drinks. Perfect. My only wish is that the bar was bigger. It gets crammed and I think they should take one stool out.

The cocktails are delicious though I've been stuck on the Framboise. It's some bubbly with fresh lemon juice and a raspberry liquor. Its refreshing but not too sweet. It's subtle. I love it. Other than that, they have something for everyone from what I can tell. The bartenders are inviting and know how to mix a cocktail paying attention to every little detail. They have also been helpful for suggestions which is great. 

I will absolutely continue to come back to this place. I only worry that once the word is out, it will get jammed packed as it's pretty small.","Nick's has absolutely ruined all other roast beef sandwiches for me. I am completely unwilling to settle for anything less than a Roast Beef Combo Overboard. Their gravy fries are to die for (they use the same gravy as they use on the sandwiches and then add some scraps of roast beef on top, yum!) This is definitely not the place to go on a first date, you will be elbow deep in gravy no matter how daintily you try to eat that sandwich.

1,"P P grocery what what!

I love your asian spice in a can and your cheap ass rice noodles. Your fresh made tofu has saved me a fortune over the years. P P I love your hair!","Nothing like setting the night off proper. In the adult sense of course. A few of us got together for a nice cultural evening at the opera and decided to do dinner beforehand. We decided on Village Whiskey as we are all seasoned whiskey sippers. I've heard the restaurant was good but man... Now, I won't call it a proper restaurant, nor will I call it a pub, but I will call it a great idea that has been executed with style, class, and gusto. It's a small spot a little wider than a narrow bar with some booths and some tables. Simple, clean, and it has elements of both new and old... But enough about that... On to the food.

When looking at the menu you almost think to yourself, hrmmm, this is a small menu. And you're right it is small. But the food isn't really the point, the whiskey is. Anyway, this small menu packs a pretty big punch. Since there were 4 of us we ordered a few things and shared. We had the deviled eggs, which would've made your Mennonite grandmother proud, the tater tots which were crunchy on the outside and buttery smooth on the inside, pickled artichokes with some toasted bread and the fried cheese puffs which hot damn... I want a platter next time. We all dug right in and were immediately impressed. The prices on these apps were incredible too. $3 each for most of these at a Garces restaurant??!? What!?! Sweet!

The whiskey. The menu was HUGE! Our server was knowledgeable and if we had questions about a particular whiskey she was happy to give a brief synopsis. The specialty drink menu was also a force to be reckoned with. I had an ""Old Fashioned"" that would have made my father proud. My buddy Mike had the APA which consists of a few awesome ingredients like hops infused vodka and egg whites. Sounds strange but tastes amazing. 

The main course - Because whiskey isn't dinner. I had the Village Burger. I am going to go ahead and rank this burger up there with some of the best burgers in the city. I ordered it medium and it came medium. Check! I topped it with bacon, gruyere cheese, and caramelized onions. The flavor of the fresh grass fed beef was incredible. My wife had the pulled pork and that too was incredible. The pork was nice and tender, juicy, and flavor packed. We split a side of the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce too. These fries are to die for.

In the end we left fat and happy. The awesome whiskey list had us buzzing and the great eats left us jolly. We waddled our way over to the opera and had a great night.

I have always had a soft spot in my heart for La Madeleine's. My first visit to this chain was some 20 years ago or so, when I came to visit my older sister, and she brought me to one for lunch. You walk in, go through the cafeteria type line, pick what you want, pay and order, then pick your seat. Any food that needs to be made will be brought out to you. The staff are all friendly, even when the line seems to be a million miles long. The cookies and baked goods all look so delicious.

Their soups are wonderful, and made in house. Their sandwiches are all good, as are their quiches.  During peak periods, it can get a bit messy inside, but there is always someone walking around, sweeping the floors and bussing the tables. The restrooms are almost always clean and well stocked.","It's an interesting place and right in the middle of the Central West End. Decent food, although it always seems to fall a little below top notch, you always leave thinking that you almost had the most amazing meal of your life.

1,"After reading the many positive reviews, I was anxious to try this place out.   Although I was prepared for takeout on this visit, I was surprised that it is ONLY takeout.   This is one of my pet peeves about Yelp i.e. That  this is not clear in the survey questions.  But I digress....

Everything from here was tasty.   The baguette is good but not as good as others available around the city.  It is pleasantly chewy but very dense.   I would rate it 4 stars.   Croissants were great and large 4.5 stars, and available in ham and cheese, chocolate, and plain.   I also sampled a variety of pastries - key lime, lemon, cheesecake square, and coconut. All strong 4s.

Coffee is also available for takeout but they also had Vietnamese iced coffee ready for takeout!   Yum! 5 stars and a great surprise on a summer day.    Parking can be challenging.  Service is great.","Went here with a friend who has been here before.   After this meal I'm surprised its still in business.   It's a steakhouse so, I ordered steak (my dining partner ordered chicken).   Steaks come with either the salad bar (very 70s) or a soup and one side.  I opted for the latter.  The soup of the day was potato soup which tasted like the one from Houlihan's in the 90s.   The steak was either frozen or was a reheat as it had that liver-y taste that a properly prepared strip steak should never have.   The side I ordered was steamed broccoli but the plate was delivered with the broccoli and a pile of commercial fake fried onions.   Not a place I will return to....gets an extra star for free Wi-Fi.","Text1: After reading the many positive reviews, I was anxious to try this place out.

I loved all 45 minutes of it. I am still learning how to get the most out of my rowing technique, but I loved the core exercises that we did in between.

They put a very strong focus on your mid-section in the class, but you also get a great shoulder, arm  and back workout at the same time.

They didn't act like this was a problem at all and moved a few tables around to seat us, then right after we ordered a larger, more comfortable table opened and they moved us over. They acted like they were inconveniencing us and apologized a million times, then sent over an order of rock shrimp tempura on the house.

I also shared the special roll of the day and some tuna and avocado rolls, and everything was really fresh and satisfying.

1,"Not sure if they were on their best behavior because of the influx of Fantasies in Chocolate people coming out for the afterparty, or if they have just righted the ship that was off course or what.  But my experience at Lex Nightclub was just fine.

We didn't have bottle service or anything special.  We had some free tickets because of going to Fantasies in Chocolate so we expected to go in, check out the place and then head out.  But instead we stayed for about an hour.  I did my white man overbite shuffle and then let my wife tear up the dance floor looking smoking hot and happy.  Nothing makes a man happier than seeing his wife enjoying herself.

We didn't get any drinks because we knew we would be driving soon enough, but I did get a few waters and the bar staff was super friendly and helpful and hardworking.  The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.

The music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.

This by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to ""da club"".

After doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.

Oh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy ""eyecandy"" up on platforms everywhere.  So he will be looking, it's only natural, if this will get you in a fight, go elsewhere.","Found out a few weeks ago that the sushi place on Longley had become another Rickshaws. Admittedly we hadn't been to the original Rickshaw's for a long time.  So we decided it was time, because now we can kill two birds with one stone.  We can check out the new location as well as see how Rickshaws is doing without our favorite manager. Well then of course there is the benefit of supporting restaurants on our side of town.
  Understandably they were slow, there was only one other party in at the time...like many new restaurants can be when taking over for a failed business.  But so far it seems that failure is not the plan here.  The quality of the service is good.  They were willing to make different hand rolls of my design and were willing to go the extra mile.  

It seems that the fish is well cared for, like it was at Rickshaws in the past.  No new menu surprises but nothing to complain about, either.

I will go back!

0,Love this place for the crab omelet...the ingredients were fresh and uniquely put together.  The service was great.  A bit loud and very busy during the day so definitely call in advance for a reservation.,"For as long as I have been in the Doylestown area (living and working), and the amount of times I have driven by, it took me until just last weekend to finally stop in for breakfast.  Not a bad place, a cluttered 50's theme diner with good eats.  Omelettes were large and quite delicious.  I was looking forward to the Jalapeno toast but they were out when we were there.  Coffee was decent.  If your in the mood for typical diner fare in a unique environment, then this is worth a stop.  I can now check it off my list after 7 years.","Text1: Love this place for the crab omelet...the ingredients were fresh and uniquely put together.  The service was great.  A bit loud and very busy during the day so definitely call in advance for a reservation.

I've enjoyed most things there. The Bird and Pig was quite good as well as their veggie burger. They also have lots of theme nights, but I've never been to one.","All MK stores are pretty much the same no matter where you go. You know what you are going to get, that the prices are going to be the same everywhere. So the only real difference is the size of the store and the staff.

This store just recently expanded and it is now HUGE!! With a clothing section (many stores are just accessories), a big shoe section, and many different bad lines. The staff seems to be fairly new and different every time I go in, but on my last visit there was a couple really nice girls that helped me find an iPhone 6 case for me to give my Mom. I really appreciated their help, and they wrapped it beautifully - especially for a lower priced item. I will totally be back.","Text1: Tasty place to grab a unique sandwich or something else with some tasty beer.

I have been here many times for dining and many times just for drinking and have never been disappointed. They have several vegetarian options and a great beer list. 

They tend to be pretty busy most of the time, so be patient if you don't find a seat right away. One will open up and it will be worth the wait. Because they are busy, the servers tend to be busy as well. They might not always see you if you are in need of something in between their normal rounds to your table, so if you need something during that time, nicely try to get their attention. That being said, between their normal rounds to your table, unless you are chugging, you most likely won't be on empty in your beer before you see them again. 

The garlic cheddar fries are pretty damn delicious and you can never go wrong with their homemade black bean burger.","I've been to Centennial Hall now a few times, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  It's a relatively small theatre, which means most of the seats offer pretty good views!  Nothing is too far away, so the show experience is pretty good.

We usually don't sit center stage, but rather at one of the sides, and there has never been any theatre obstruction in the way of the view.  The only issue I've ever had was a really tall guy in the seat in front of me.  I, too, am somewhat tall, but this man was easily 6'5"".  I couldn't see over him so I had to keep looking around him.  It was a nuisance.  If the seats were at more of a slope, that would have helped, but I doubt that will change.  But other than a really tall person in front of you, the views from just about anywhere seem great!  

The seats themselves are a bit small, but not too horrible.  They're not the most padded seats, either, but they don't bother me.  I just mention it in case others are interested in that kind of detail.  The rows are a bit slender, but like I said, I'm somewhat tall (5'10"") and my knees don't hit the seat in front of me.  But I do need to stand to let others pass.  No big deal, I have plenty of room to move around.  Overall, I don't feel terribly smooshed in Centennial Hall's seats, but more space would clearly be more comfortable.

The amenities are decent.  The bathrooms have always been clean and the lines move relatively quickly.  The concessions have all the refreshments you need, and those lines move along quickly, too.  They also move the entrance line along quickly, too!  Efficiency!

The lobby is a little bit quaint, so at a sold out show, it can get tight in there waiting for the doors to open.  The doors have opened more or less on time at each show we've been to.

I like Centennial Hall and I'm so happy we have Broadway in Tucson!  It is a real plus for our city!","Text1: Indoors, outdoors, for food, or for drinks: Chatham Tap does it all.

1,"Great shop, lots of neat finds by independent local artisans. Made a purchase as a Christmas gift after seeing the item on Etsy and figured buying in the city would be more convenient than having to have the item shipped. The markup on the item was pretty significant, but I chalked it up to helping keep small business in business even if purchasing from the vendor directly essentially would have been doing the same for a much more reasonable price. Debated returning the item and purchasing closer to the holiday when I had made the final determination on my gift purchases, but was informed that returns are only in the form of store credit. Kind of a bummer given that the purchase was made day of and that I was on the fence about the item to begin with. Great shop with lovely employees and terrific options, I would absolutely buy here again but only if I was 100% set on my purchase.","Yeah, I know what you're thinking...5-stars for Comcast?? I wouldn't normally believe it myself, but this is not about call-center service, technicians, or issues with connectivity...this is a story about how one customer service agent turned our entire move around. After walking into a pretty hellish new apartment situation, we were looking for a way to salvage the day. We had to stop and run the typical new move errands of South Philly and were stopping by Budget to pick up a moving truck so we figured now was as good a time as any to stop by Comcast to set up our new account. The previous tenant of the apartment had put a stop-date of service on her account mid-month even though we were moving in on the 1st; online account creation wasn't possible so we nervously went to the CSC fearing that the experience would be miserable....

....guess what? It wasn't! I don't know if we just caught a lucky break, or maybe because it was the day after a holiday/Sunday, but even being #3 in the queue we didn't wait more than 5 minutes to be seen. Our CSR, Antonio, got us hooked up, fixed the information that was holding up our account, walked us through cost for packages and sent us on our way all in 30 minutes. Parking aside (there's next to none of it and you're on a sketch service road), I would almost recommend setting up your account here rather than over the phone.

0,"We stopped at Nosh after a night of parades and the place was awesome!

Immediately you connect with the staff; the music is just right and enjoyable; the seating along with the decor is attractive and suitable..

The food above all with the drinks were tasty.

The manager Jeff welcomes all guests and consistently walking around checking on his guests.","I stopped by Chazumba for a followup visit yesterday to check out some more tacos.   I ordered longaniza and carnitas, which were served up promptly.  The longaniza was delicious, and matched up well with the excellent salsa verde.  The carnitas was a disappointment.  As I found at another taqueria in the area, unlike the pulled pork which often makes up carnitas, this taco was completely filled with parts of a pig I didn't recognize.  I'm usually an adventurous eater, but this looked so bad I didn't touch it and threw it away.  Looking back, I should have brought it up with the friendly owner, Roberto, but our conversation moved to other topics.  I'll definitely ask him next time about it, as it's possible I was served up something like tripe in error.

I thought I'd add some additional info on Chazumba as a followup.  The interior is very simple, minimal decor and about ~20 seats.  Their menu has10 kinds of tacos (steak, chicken, pastor (marinated pork), suadero (brisket), lengua (tounge), carnitas (pork), longaniza (spicy sausage), cabeza (cow head), tripe, and Barbados (lamb only available on weekends).  I didn't see shrimp offered this time, so I'll need to ask if it's still available.

In addition they have burritos, huaracha, quesadilla, sopes, alambre (meats and cheese), and 10 kinds of tortas ($7-10).  Also available is 3 roast chicken dishes, 3 homemade soups, and 6 desserts (including flan and strawberries & cream).  Rounding out the menu is fruit jello, apple salad and pastes (a small pastry stuffed with a variety of fillings).

To wash all of that down, make sure to try the aguas frescas, an uncarbonated ""fruit water"" prepared every day.  Unlike a typical Kool-Aid or punch, these are not overly sweet at all, just full of great, mild fruit flavor, served out of a huge jug filled with ice.  The flavor of the day was peach/mango, and it was delicious.

And if you have a chance, introduce yourself to Roberto and his lovely wife Rosemary, who work from 9am-midnight 7 days each week to deliver their authentic tastes.  They are both extremely friendly, and are glad to chat when the crowd thins out.

All the cardio equipment is up-to-date and I don't know why there is inconsistency with some of the other machines. Regardless, this is a center that can match any fitness goal and cater to different needs and interests. Plenty of exercise classes to choose from! 

If you are the general public, then you won't be able to call this your gym. I'm sure if that was the case, thousands of more people would want to work out here. As for the students, alumnus, and employees of the UA, get the most out of your association with the University and commit to fitness at the center!",yes
1,"I can't help but stop at Beck's every time I'm in the Amish market....and Beiler's for cake...but I digress. Becky's has these great Mac n' cheese balls that are so fun and delicious! I could probably eat these suckers everyday until I'm 500 lbs.

Beck's version of the NOLA cheese steak is also worth gaining a few extra lbs. It is filled with delicious spicy sausage and extra seasoned for the creole kick to the mouth. 

The staff is super friendly here and will give you a sample of anything before you commit to purchasing which is great if you don't know what level of heat you can handle. The line is usually barely as well, in comparison the other other places around. Beck's you got me boo.","I live down the block from Kelly's Kitchen and sadly the strip mall location really didn't make it like an appealing place to have breakfast. Thankfully my Yelp app compared it to my ALL TIME favorite bfast spot - Old Croydon Cafe - so I decided to give it a shot. Overall, a solid old school diner experience. 

The inside of the place is a lot more modern than I expected, also much more spacious. It has plenty of seating room for parties mostly of 4 and singles at the bar top. Our server was very friendly and came promptly giving us the daily specials. The prices are great for the amount of food you get, especially during the week! 

I decided to order the Bensalem Special - 1 pancake, 1 french toast, 1 sausage, homefries, bacon, AND two eggs over easy - ALL of this only $8.50! Needless to say I got through half and was STUFFED. You can easily share this plate with one other person. As for the pancake, it was very regular, nothing notable. The homefries were fancy, I love when places add some spice. They also had a huge list of omlettes that I would like to try.

Our server was friendly and kept our coffee cups full - which I love. I even asked for a spoonful  of the gravy for future ordering reference and she brought out a small bowl and it was delicious. I would definitely come back and make sure to bring CASH!","Text1: I can't help but stop at Beck's every time I'm in the Amish market....and Beiler's for cake...but I digress.

1,"I ate an early dinner at Brio on a Saturday evening.  I ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka (Ricotta-filled pasta, spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce, crispy pancetta, basil.) My dinner date ordered the Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops with Mashed Potatoes on the side. The service was friendly and speedy. My water glass was kept filled and the bread here is always fresh and good. The pork chops were very well liked as was my pasta. The only thing I will say though is I felt the portion was extremely small for a $20 plate of pasta. They are always busy though. Clearly I'm in the minority. Be careful in that bar. A cougar might get you.","The Blue Duck describes itself as a relaxed tavern featuring classic and new American eats. OK, I can go with that. I stopped in on a Tuesday night to the new Maplewood location with my father and stepmother. We got there right around six and we were the only table but after a couple of minutes it started filling up. Thank goodness because I have a thing about being the only table in a restaurant. I never want to eat somewhere that no one else wants to eat but we were OK here. Our server was friendly and pleasant but not that well versed on the menu. My father was asking about the Chow Chow side and she was trying to describe the flavor to him and I blurted out that it's pickled vegetables and she said oh yes, pickled is correct, they're pickled. So we ordered the Falafel Balls (harrissa tahini, smoked green tomato jam, cilantro, grilled flatbread) appetizer for the table. The grind of the chickpeas was too fine and the falafel had little flavor. The pita bread had a nice char but was very thick and cut in tiny triangles. The harrissa tahini turned out to be incredibly spicy and we are a family that likes heat. My father ate so much of the sauce he was sucking on ice cubes to relieve the heat. He was worried he wasn't going to be able to eat his entree. He ordered the DLT, a duck sandwich, and subbed the side for a small salad. The salad was tiny and no big deal but the sandwich he really liked. He commented on how moist and flavorful the duck was. My stepmother ordered the Seared Trout. This dish was beautifully presented and quite good. There was a tower of fried brussels sprouts on top and a squash puree under the fish. It was all excellent. As soon as I read the Pastrami and Pimiento sandwich I knew I had to order that. I love pastrami and I love pimiento cheese. I got the Mac N Cheese side which was just fair. The sandwich was delicious. I was only able to eat half of it. It was messy but good. I'd order it again and again. They ordered the cookie plate for dessert but I couldn't eat any. I was too full. The macarons looked delicious. Maybe next time.","Text1: I ate an early dinner at Brio on a Saturday evening.

0,"The first dinner out for our Philly family feastgiving. We called many weeks ahead, they were unable to accommodate a party of 12 so they said they would set up two tables of 6. (at least they were willing, unlike another orange colored squash restaurant) Kind of ridiculous since all the tables are two tops, just make some tetris like moves and make it happen. 

Like other reviewers we showed up a few minutes early for our reservation. One table was set the other we had to wait almost 30 minutes for. Thankfully there was another large party celebrating a birthday so as we moved from table to table to visit we weren't a disruption. 

The service of constantly rotating silverware and wine pouring was friendly and timely. A sense of humor shared for our carlo rossi growler. The little clover bread rolls were delicious and they brought more upon request. 

Items that were sampled, 

Scallops that had a wonderful crispy pan sear. The lardons were crisp. 

Beet salad seemed to have the beet skin intact, which was a puzzler but delicious. 

Kampachi, just lightly seared which had a smokey undertone and bright pomegranate. 

Stuffed rabbit saddle, very mild, tender and highlighted by a herb sauce and truffle.

Stripped bass was seared well, the vegetables were well seasoned and caramelized. 

Duck breast was served rare, some slices were a but chewy, the farro and veg a great consistency.

Boar shank was fall apart tender atop greens, hearty winterish meal.

Pappardelle with pork shoulder ragu was another winterish meal, with tender diced veg. 

Strip steak was cooked as ordered, blue corn polenta wasn't a favorite of anyone, but the brussels sprouts were well caramelized

We ended with a few chocolate napoleons, the filo dough was treated with caramel and sea salt, highlighted with fresh whipped cream. It was a nice rich yet light end bite. 

We all had a great time and would return. Overall comments concluded that the protein servings were inconsistent but the vegetable preparations were spot on.","I was pleased with the service here. I had been in contact with six other dealers in Tucson on Phoenix. And while Thoroughbred had the vehicle of my second choice I went with it because I felt like I was respected and getting a reasonable deal. 

The showroom and offices are clean, the feel is professional and the staff seemed pretty honest and also attentive. I did not feel pressured, ignored or harassed like I did at two other places in town.","Text1: The first dinner out for our Philly family feastgiving.

0,"Really great for the price, but nothing blew me away in awesomeness.

We tried the Tokyo Tower, which was very interesting and surprisingly quite tasty. It had some raw tuna, rice, apple slices, and cucumber, with thin fried potato chips on top! I never would have tried it if my boyfriend hadn't been insistent on trying something random and new.

We also got the Sunset roll which didn't sound very appealing but a friend kept telling us it was great, and I'm glad we branched out because it was pretty good. The dragon roll had slightly over-cooked unagi which was rather disappointing. The crunch roll was very crunchy and ideal, but nothing that special.

I do love that this place serves soup and salad with your meal, even at dinner on a Saturday night! I don't think most other places can beat that. Although I didn't care for the soup (very salty) or the salad (too much dressing), the touch was appreciated.

The service is also fairly good, although there's a waiter in particular who constantly tried to take our plates before we were finished. Our friend warned us about him and he was right! My boyfriend concluded that maybe they let him eat people's leftovers and that's why he's so hell-bent on taking our food away! Who knows.

It's nice to have a good sushi place so close to us but I have yet to find my favorite in StL.","Wait, I haven't written about Federal Donuts yet?

That's a crime.

I guess I was too busy eating up their delicious donuts, and most recently, their most-amazing fried chicken. Truth be told, I was a big supporter long before this place ever opened. I'm a big fattycakes and I'm down with whatever food that will proportionally kick my lifespan down a few notches for how good it sounds. That, and an admiration of the most spectacular Felicia whose smile is known to make hearts skip beats. We also can't forget Mike Solo, one of the best chefs that our city has to offer (Zahav is still one of my favorite restaurants), and the Bodhi Coffee folks.

Despite my bias, being a fan of all the respective robot cats that form this sensational restaurant Voltron I can objectively admit that this place blows my mind. I admire the creativity in each one of their products. I will stand by every item I've taken a bite out of. I will even defend the sometimes absurd wait times or unavailability of products at unexpectedly early hours.

It's that good.

The donuts are dense, delicious. I've only had the pomegranate nutella tehina, key lime and indian cinnamon, all of which rocked. The pomnutehina is perhaps my favorite, followed closely by by the indian cinnamon.

Last weekend my girlfriend and I arrived at 11:20-something in order to get a ticket to buy fried chicken at 11:45. We didn't actually walk out of there until 12:00 or so. That's at least a 40min wait for some fried chicken. Worth it? Hell yeah it was. They even came with some plain honey donuts, which were dense and delicious as the others.

We had the harissa and chile-garlic fried chicken. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had? Yes. Perhaps the best in the city? Could be.

Anyhow, lucky for me (unlucky for my waistband) I live within walking distance. I'm a fan, to say the least.","Text1: Really great for the price, but nothing blew me away in awesomeness.

Nothing's better then a warm bowl of Pho on a cold night. 

This place is authentic Vietnamese cuisine that's best in St Albert. I prefer the Pho or the Vermicelli bowl over their rice dishes. I still haven't had their salad rolls but the spring rolls have a nice crunch but leave a little to be desired. 

I usually don't have room after dinner but I really enjoy Vietnamese iced coffees and they do it exactly how I like it.

I haven't seen any Nam-wiches on their menu and I wish there were cuz they are quite tasty and normally well priced.","Text1: It wasn't my favorite bar of the bar hop.

The curry was flavored perfectly and I wish I had more rice to soak it in and then more curry to soak that additional rice in. It was sweet and spicy and delicious.","A good noodle house.

I explained what I was looking for, and she directed me to the appropriate areas. She complimented my ring, and asked if she could see it.

We will be back!","My girlfriend and I stopped in here last night, expecting the normal Reginelli's awesomeness. The food was fine, but this location has greatly changed since the last time I've been. I normally go to the State St Reginelli's, but since moving further downtown this location is more convenient to me.
We should have left the moment we went to go sit near the window and there was a SWARM of flies near the table. Blech. We decided to sit in a booth, which was still dirty from the last customers, but we didn't have much of a choice since most of the tables were either dirty, still had plates on them, or were occupied.
Another thing I noticed was that this location was very dark. Maybe I hadn't noticed it before because I had only come during the day? I don't know. At this point, my GF and I had already sat down and ordered our drinks so we decided to stay, but we felt very uncomfortable.
The combination of the darkness, dirtiness, and flies everywhere made me scarf down my pizza just so we could get the hell out of there. Like I said, our food was fine, but next time I am craving Reginelli's I will make sure to go to the State St location even if they chronically mess up my take out orders, they always get it right when I dine in.","Text1: Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and decent food options.

 Text2: My girlfriend and I stopped in here last night, expecting the normal Reginelli's awesomeness. The food was fine, but this location has greatly changed since the last time I've been. I normally go to the State St Reginelli's, but since moving further downtown this location is more convenient to me.
We should have left the moment we went to go sit near the window and there was a SWARM of flies near the table. Blech. We decided to sit in a booth, which was still dirty from the last customers, but we didn't have much of a choice since most of the tables were either dirty, still had plates on them, or were occupied.
Another thing I noticed was that this location was very dark. Maybe I hadn't noticed it before because I had only come during the day? I don't know. At this point, my GF and I had already sat down and ordered our drinks so we decided to stay, but we felt very uncomfortable.
The combination of the darkness, dirtiness, and flies everywhere made me scarf down my pizza just so we could get the hell out of there. Like I said, our food was fine, but next time I am craving Reginelli's I will make sure to go to the State St location even if they chronically mess up my take out orders, they always get it right when I dine in.",no
0,"Stopped in for what my colleague and I thought would be a fairly quick lunch between appointments. We were referred to the hamburgers, prepared with local organically raised beef.

The crowd didn't seem too big. We had plenty of room for parking and available table immediately. 

After a while our server asked for drink orders... Limited to tea and RC products... Really -- RC?  I know it is a TN ""thing"" but seriously.

We each ordered a burger and fries.

Then waited. and waited. and waited.

We had a clear view of the kitchen, with looked to be moving and working, with 5 or 6 line cooks working.

The griddle didn't look small. But I from the time we ordered to the time we ate was 35-40 minutes.

For a burger.

I've come to expect a much faster burger service.

Gabby's (best in town) keeps a constant line moving with what - 2 people in the kitchen? Five guys same deal. The burger at Backyard Burgers isn't much worst than the one at Melrose... and they'll have it out by the time you get to the window.

So -- how was this burger?  Fine. Nothing special or un-special. It lacked any distinctive taste of being grass fed, like the most excellent burger at Gabby's. 

Fries were unremarkable.

In short, it seems the pub is more about the drink and less about the kitchen. And maybe if we were drinking for Friday lunch, we might have not though so much about the wait...","$4 smothered onion hashbrowns, wheat toast with apple butter, and three eggs.

I still love the Hogg Slop, their interpretation of poutine.  Lately I have been ordering The Cure.

I would still recommend having reservations as this place is busy after all the social media buzz.",Wow. I never thought that I could taste Italy again.

Mostly I came here for beer, they have a decent selection and thier prices are not too high. I like a place where you can buy fancier microbrews and colt 45 in the same place. 

One plus is they allow you to open your beer in the restaurant, so you can have a really inexpensive dinner with your choice of beer.","I came here for a weekend brunch, and it was packed!

They had most of your standard breakfast foods. I got an eggs Benedict, and it was what you would expect. Location close to Rittenhouse is great, and the atmosphere is lively.

I feel that late teens and 20s is a specific age range that is best taken care of in a family practice office or one specifically for young adults.  In addition to that, I wanted my doctor to have flexible hours and be tech-savvy.  This location is very good about making same day appointments and if they can't squeeze you in, they actually have a walk in clinic attached to the office.  They also send out automatic emails and texts to you if you opt for these reminders.  The office is also very responsive and responds to requests within hours.  My doctor, Dr. Thorley is very thorough and easy to talk to.  I can also log into my patient files online with an online account.  Whats even better is this office is connected to Vanderbilt hospital so any service you use at Vanderbilt is in their internal system.

1,"Really outstanding food...not much of a wait saturday morning.

Brady (server)was informed, enthusiastic, efficient, pleasant, and offered helpful suggestions....rather than the unibquitous ""everything is good""...or the very nearly offensive....""What do you like ???""

Everything we tried, was excellent, served at a proper temperature, held up well over an extended meal.  Oysters were outstanding.

The cocktails were very good, very interesting and prepared with care and superb execution.  Too damn bad they contain so much alcohol :(

While there are reasonably priced items...the lovely young lady and I spent about $150 with a generous and well deserved tip.

I am not of the opinion that the sparse interior adds to the charm...however it certainly did not detract from the overall enjoyable experience.

On site parking is a huge plus in the increasingly clogged area.","Quite good...fresh ingredients.....super nice people with no language barrier....

if you are eating in house...be sure to ask for real utensils...

burrito was plenty full, and delicious....just not as impressed with salsas as I am at other places.

0,"I freakin' love this place.  The downtown location was a favorite of mine when I worked in that area, but now they have opened one in Brentwood, near the Chick-Fil-A.  So, when I'm out there, I have more than one choice of places to eat!  

Actually, they have had a Chile Burrito restaurant out there for probably over a year now, but they have just redone the entire strip mall (yes it's the 'burbs, of course it's in a strip mall!) so they have a nice shiny new place.  

These are burritos to order--just like in the other location--so you pick the kind of tortilla, then choose what you want in it.  Fresh ingredients, and lots of them!  They also have salads if you don't want to go the burrito route.  And cheese dip!  And spicy, fresh salsas!  

Thank you, Chile Burrito, for bringing fresh food in a non-chainy atmosphere to Brentwood!","I've often passed this swanky little place in Downtown filled with good-looking professionals laughing over drinks, appetizers and spilling over the sidewalk

Although you probably won't get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail ""The Tryst"" didn't impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I'll forget it tomorrow. 

SERVICE
Thanks Yelp for introducing me here. It's easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a ""vegetable"" beer they offered--spot on. 

SUMMARY
I'll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours. Cool, hip place to bring the girlfriends or if you're looking for impressive, gutsy art dishes with good taste.... and if you have cash to blow (but I won't let that subtract a review star)","Text1: I freakin' love this place.

Again exiting the conference for an extended break as the City of Nashville's humidity finally gave way to rain, it was perhaps an oversight of Vanderbilt's love of a boozy brunch that saw us arrive at Tavern to the tune of a 90-minute wait, the time largely spent wandering nearby Centennial Park beneath umbrellas until a text called us forth from the Pantheon to be seated amongst a mass of humanity with well lubricated co-eds screaming to be heard above the loud tunes echoing from high ceilings overhead.

Dining with a pair of ladies from the era which several of the restaurant's 1960s tunes were sourced, and thus clearly not of a demographic common during the hour of our meal, suffice it to say that the ninety minute wait was further compromised by overstretched service that saw our table ignored until a manager was flagged down fifteen minutes later, the kitchen itself equally stressed but trying to make good by sending out four scoops of luke-warm ""White Trash Hash"" as the wait-time for plates was extended another twenty-five minutes after the order was eventually placed.

Informed that desserts are only offered at dinner, and as such going even sweeter than usual with mains, it was finally the restaurant's thinly poured flapjacks that crossed our lips and although a better effort could have been made than a topping of pretzels straight from a bag it would be difficult to find any other fault in the buttermilk triplet, the sticky-sweet caramel finding an unexpectedly willing dancing partner in light chocolate mousse that produced a flavor not unlike that of tres leches as it soaked the pancakes straight down to the plate.","Dishes sampled included:

The second of two 'breakfasts' that day my visit to Kanella featured two of my favorite dining companions and ordering widely from the interesting Greek inspired menu I think we all walked away quite impressed by not only the quality of the food but also of the service; a small family run operation where everyone was more than happy to tell you about the recipes and heritage of each dish.  Not well versed in Greek food and actually not at all a fan of grape leaves or Tzanziki the beauty of this menu for me was the more esoteric options such as the savory puff pastry and the sweets - the crepe and the Galatopoureko particularly excellent; I'd definitely revisit for breakfast or dinner, particularly given the wonderful family atmosphere and bargain prices for food I generally do not go out of my way for - an experience both delicious and educational.","Text1: Items Selected:

The second of two 'breakfasts' that day my visit to Kanella featured two of my favorite dining companions and ordering widely from the interesting Greek inspired menu I think we all walked away quite impressed by not only the quality of the food but also of the service; a small family run operation where everyone was more than happy to tell you about the recipes and heritage of each dish.  Not well versed in Greek food and actually not at all a fan of grape leaves or Tzanziki the beauty of this menu for me was the more esoteric options such as the savory puff pastry and the sweets - the crepe and the Galatopoureko particularly excellent; I'd definitely revisit for breakfast or dinner, particularly given the wonderful family atmosphere and bargain prices for food I generally do not go out of my way for - an experience both delicious and educational.",yes
0,"The sales portion of the store is full of nice clothing with sales associates tending to you as if they are waiters at Antoine's, but everything is certainly overpriced. The rental portion of the store though is abyssmal. I have failed to ever have anything fit remotely correct; plus, the pricing reflects the clothing sales portion but without the service they provide ""downstairs.""","This place makes me channel my inner Julia Stiles circa Save the Last Dance, wishing I was more Center Stage than awkward white girl koreshing ... and burning. Had to. 

WARNING: THEY HAVE MOVED! Just checked out their new studio for a free class yesterday  (located at 20th and Rittenhouse) and LOVED IT. Hated myself for being an uncoordinated mess, but whatevs.

I don't know that the new studio itself is that much more spacious (although the area to hang out in pre-class is, and there is now a small locker room) Then again the huge crowd that turned out for the free class probably did not help...

HIP HOP CLASSES
I've been to Sammy's beginner (intro $5 class-print the coupon off their site!) and intermediate (lol I know, but it was free) hip hop and he is amazing. He is a hilarious, fierce, fast dancing, fast talking, AWESOME teacher, and he will make you wish you were as cool as him and make you want to be a hip hop dancer. His classes are basically some warm ups, then he teaches you a routine, and then halves of the room alternate doing the routine. Everyone is very supportive and claps and doesn't give you death stares even if you suck and can't get the steps and are always in everyone's way because you are 5 beats behind.

CAVEATS: 
1. If you are not a dancer and just want a workout class, like me, this will be challenging, but you'll get a workout for sure.
2. The prices. They are high. $20 is steep if you are not a dancer.

Recommend for dancers, and to everyone who has $5 and could use a laugh/sweat/pick-me-up!","Text1: The sales portion of the store is full of nice clothing with sales associates tending to you as if they are waiters at Antoine's, but everything is certainly overpriced.

0,"Once again in my quest to satiate my appetite I find myself literally in the middle of nowhere eating some of the most delicious soon du bu in recent memory. Not that my experience with this deliciously hearty tofu soup is worth mentioning but it's very tasty here!! Accompanying the soups are a slew of comdiments ranging from kim chee to bean sprouts- pickled vegetables never tasted so good..Spiciness level can be adjusted from wimp to bad ass (I was on the wimpy side and found it perfectly spiced). Sevice was the only thing that left much to be desired for. I'm guessing they had no idea what I was saying, but multiple requests for water were unheard or ignored... At any rate if you find yourself meandering even remotely close to 66th ave- head on by!!!","I was really hoping that my 200th review would result in a stellar five-star experience. I even took myself out of my familiar neighborhood and into an area where I thought I had a better chance of snagging that five-star review. While I was tempted to try out the nearby Nickel Plate Bar & Grill, I opted for Brixx Wood Fired Pizza inside The Depot right off East 116th Street and right next to the Fishers city government complex. 

Parking is a wee bit tricky with construction going on within the city complex area, but there's an adjacent parking garage that offers spots for those visiting the retail area of The Depot. There's also one ADA disabled parking spot on the street. 

The restaurant itself is accessible with a workable door going in. I was attracted to Brixx by their sign offering a $7.95 luncheon special, though I arrived toward what the end of what would be considered lunch. I was dining alone and was escorted to a small end of the bar that had been clearly designed for wheelchairs. Giordano's has this same kind of counter. I wished I'd taken my seat cushion as the counter was just a touch higher than my wheelchair and required some stretch. They also offer outdoor dining that is wheelchair friendly. 

Brixx Wood Fired Pizza offers, of course, wood-fired pizzas - they are all 10"" pizzas and come in nearly 25 varieties including veggie and gluten free options. Vegan cheese is available at no charge, but there's a $3 upcharge for gluten-free crust. The prices range from $8.95 - $13.95. The lunch option either wasn't an option or simply wasn't offered - as I knew I was splurging on ice cream, I didn't want to totally blow my dietary regimen by eating an entire pizza. So, I looked at the sandwich menu that includes six sandwiches/wraps. They also offer starters, pasta, beer, wine, cocktails, salads, desserts, and a kids menu. I opted for a Roasted Chicken Club on toasted focaccia. While I'd thought it was $8.95, a review of the online menu does confirm it is the only sandwich not $8.95 - It's $9.95. You have the choice of chips, quinoa salad, bean salad, or fresh fruit as a side. I opted for chips. 

The entire bill came in at right around $13 with my unsweetened iced tea. 

The sandwich arrived and was about what you'd expect from a pizza/deli type sandwich. It was good, but it was quickly becoming clear that a 5-star review was not in the cards. The sandwich was tasty, but a bit light on the ingredients. However, they mixed together well. It was good and I would eat it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it. The chips were a nice accompaniment, sort of in the Broad Ripple Chip Company ballpark (but not as good). If I could give a .5 star, the food would easily be in the 3.5 range. 

The service? It's always a risk to arrive at the tail end of what was considered ""lunch."" It looked like there was one manager present who was doing some training and a handful of servers and other crew handling the remaining tables, doing miscellaneous errands, and doing a wee bit too much standing around in my estimation - I say this because in my placement at the end of the bar, I had at least a couple occasions where 2-3 servers would be gathered within a couple feet talking. It was distracting to both my meal and to the magazine I was reading. 

The servers and staff were friendly, though I found service itself a bit off pace. The female who initially seated me took the iced tea order and got me set up, but it took several minutes for my server to arrive at the table. I acknowledged having difficulty deciding on options for a single diner (hoping that would trigger either the lunch special suggestion or another idea). Instead, Jeremy sort of agreed that the servings are kind of large for one person. (Suggestions, maybe?). At that point, I very nearly paid for my iced tea and left. 

I eventually decided on the meal ordered. Jeremy was more attentive and was friendly throughout, though he seemed to have other responsibilities that kept him distracted. I did receive my always desired refills, so that was a plus. Overall, I'd put the service in the 3-star range. It was a touch slow, definitely distracted, and didn't make me want to go back. I was disappointed by the lack of suggestions, a bit uncomfortable in the space where I'd been seated, and generally felt like an afterthought during the late lunch hours. However, staff were friendly and I never felt unwelcome. I also thought a couple of the servers who weren't mine actually paid more attention and were conversational. So, that helped. 

Brixx was practically the definitive 3-star experience, slightly above average - I can picture them having days where they hit that 4, but just watching them I can also understand some of the 2-star reviews given here. It certainly won't be a destination spot for me, but if I have friends who want to try it out I won't be opposed and would love to try the pizza.","Text1: Once again in my quest to satiate my appetite I find myself literally in the middle of nowhere eating some of the most delicious soon du bu in recent memory.

Great to have a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood.","Wife and I went to Tarpon Springs to witness first hand the Greek settlement that has existed for decades now. Hellas had the best reviews of all the Greek establishments on Dodecanese Blvd. 

The place was packed especially for lunch but we didn't find the food necessarily impressive. I mean it was solid, good food but not the best Greek food we've ever had.

Louis Pappas is still our favorite  until otherwise noted.","Text1: Super restaurant! Great food, service is excellent too.

0,"Incredible lunch, that totally blew my New Years diet and I am totally fine with that.  After lunch today, we can not wait to go back and experience their dinner menu. Pan D'olive may well be on its way to being a favorite. 

After receiving our ice tea, a basket of fresh house made breads and olive oil was served. The baguette was great, but the olive bread was the star of the basket. I'd love to know how Sam makes it, it is that good. The olive oil was very light, making it a perfect accent to the olive bread. 

We then ordered two small plates; Calamari and Mussels. The Calamari was the best I have had in the metro area. So many other restaurants over cook Calamari, leaving to dried out and tough chew. Here it was done to perfection, it was tender and an easy chew.  We also shared an order of Mussels. Yippee, I have another addition to my, ""I Want Mussels"" list. I could not resist the garlic, tomato, clam jus. The extra slices of baguette came in handy for soaking up the broth.

Our two lunch entrees were true Mediterranean fare. I had the Grilled Salmon with lemon and capers with a side of sautéed spinach that would have made Popeye happy. The SO enjoyed the Trout which was Walnut Encrusted and also served with that amazing spinach that makes Popeye a strong man. I am not a fan of walnuts, but it added an incredible flavor to this trout. It almost made me nutty for this trout. 

We were filled after our small plates, but pushed on and still enjoyed our entrees. Being truly filled after the entrees, we knew we couldn't stop. Being true Yelpers, it was our duty to try a dessert so our review of a new establishment was complete.  I wanted Creme Brûlée, but the SO is over Creme Brûlée, so we went with the Hazelnut Tiramisu. Once again I am not a fan of nuts on my food, but I liked it. Normally I find Tiramisu to be too sweet, but not here. It had just the right amount of sweetness. Next time, I'm getting the Creme Brûlée and enjoy it all by myself. 

When I go back, I'm trying the Lamb Sliders.","Not sure what else to say other than I love their donuts, and I think their mocha iced coffee has drugs in it.

The food was average at best.  The service had good intentions but our waitress was either very discombobulated by nature or was just having a bad day.  Pleasant but absent minded.

I will say, it lived up to the hype. I certainly agree with Chef Brooks nomination in Food & Wine mag and all the well-deserved recognition that he (& Milktooth) have received. The options are crazy good (really regret not grabbing one of those beautiful pastries!!), flavors are solid, cappuccino was perfect, decor was perfect, ect. I got the halibut, and potato & celeriac latke: both were fantastic. It wasn't necessarily relaxing because of how packed they were and the crowd waiting by the door, but this didn't ruin the experience... I just prefer a more chill brunch! Can't wait to come back though. Props to everyone working here too!","Text1: They sell Framboise, I mean really? I love this place even more purely because of this fact alone!

We go to pick up prescriptions and find they aren't ready.  Their standard excuse for this is that the doctor's office hasn't returned their calls.  We have confirmed with the doctor's office that they haven't even received calls.  Meanwhile we are driving back and forth out of our way.  It could use a total overhaul because it is rapidly becoming not worth the membership.","This place leaves much to be desired... But for an authentic ""traditional college bar"" experience & a cheap pitcher - you can't go wrong.
There's sometimes karaoke or a DJ, or people dancing on the pool tables. Other times I've been here and it's completely dead. You never know what you're going to get. One thing is certain - the service isn't very good, and you're better off drinking out of a disposable cup.
Will I return? Probably... but only for $5 pitchers or $1 wells. ha ha.","Text1: It serves the purpose of having a Sam's Club to go to, but it is lacking on many levels.

The wife and I got 6 slices of pizza two drinks all for 13 dollars. Even their regular specials are pretty cheap. A great addition to the Marana area.","Finally, there service has come around.  As I stated, their food is excellent, but I gave it a two previously for their slow service.  They have cleaned up the place a little bit and they have changed their menu.

0,"The best gelato place in the city. I've been to almost all their locations and each times have had friendly, efficient service. The one in University City especially blew my mind with their freakishly clean bathrooms. Total plus in the city!

I'm kinda bummed they got rid of the cream cheese flavor; that was one of my favorites. Others that top my list are Nutella, fior di latte, straciatella, hazelnut, and macadamia nut. Combine the macadamia nut with milk chocolate and it's like a Hawaiian Host! 

One gripe: it does get a little pricey, so my husband and I usually split a medium-sized one.","Was here not even a week ago for one night. 

PARKING - I recently went to Nashville where people were complaining about the $24 valet parking for the Embassy Suites downtown (and there was a considerably cheaper option right across the street). The Hyatt has a marginally cheaper option, but valet will run you $30. Which is crazy. Especially since at the Embassy in Nashville you don't have to go to the garage to pick up your car when you want to leave. Just out the hotel door. At the Hyatt, you have to go down to the garage. Which I find odd. 

ROOMS - I have been here twice and both rooms had a view of the arch. This time I was on the 14th floor and I could see it from the bed. The beds are stiffer. But that's personal preference.  I wasn't paying attention when I booked and somehow wound up with two full size beds. Yep, not a king or two queens but two full size. When my mother found out she said, ""full sized beds went out when Carol and Mike Brady were no longer on tv."" While I am not old enough to verify that i can say I have never seen full size beds in a hotel before.

Only thing I can figure is its because the rooms are small

OTHER: Starbucks and good food options in the hotel. Business center to print stuff off. Long list of things they will bring you to borrow (if you forgot something) or have complimentary. Didn't need to make use of the list, but it's a nice touch and had a long list of items.","Text1: The best gelato place in the city.

0,"I love Tex Mex.  Love it!  And I love SATCo's take on it.  For a fair price, you can enjoy delicious tacos, queso and an adult beverage on a sunny afternoon on the SATCo porch.  And I am all for that!

Their speed in preparing your order is something to be reckoned with.  I think I blinked and saw my plate sitting on the counter.  Maybe they could have a showdown with Jimmy Johns!

What wonderful combination of Tex Mex did I enjoy on this cool Friday afternoon?  I'm glad you asked!  I enjoyed a quickly but carefully made ground beef taco (hard shell) and fish taco (soft shell).  Both were flavorful and had a great mix of textures.  But nothing beats the queso.  Nothing, I say!!  I'm usually a white queso snob, but this yellow-orange cheesy goodness has changed me for the better.  Spicy.  Cheesy.  Delicious.

As much as I like this place, their biggest pitfall is the parking.  It's pretty much awful.  But for a good queso fix, it's worth it!","Dude.  Brah.  This is the place for Breakfast.  It looks like lunch is covered review-wise so let me tell you about the most important meal of the day.  Bekfast!

I ordered the 2-2-2.  I didn't pay attention to what the other selections were, 3-3-3 & 4-4-4 and so on, but what I picked was what I needed! Man it was great!   Oh yeah I see omelettes on the menu. 

It came with 2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon.  So I guess it's not that hard to figure out the rest of the other breakfast selections above :).  The sides that it came with that wasn't mentioned was grits, oven roasted potatoes (!) and a bread. Toast or a biscuit. Take the biscuit!  All that for $5.50!! 

I didn't notice if there was pancakes in the menu, if so, they are neck and neck with Ruby Slipper, Buns and Biscuits on Banks and City Diner.  Not a cool decor or anything fancy. Typical Westbank style but Brah ...  It's good!

Grits was just right, potatoes were seriously on point and the rest was how it should be. Perfect.  

The inside of the business must of changed since last reviewers been here. There is plenty of booth tables and the food was served on heavy plates and real silverware.    The lady that was mentioned in the other reviews is still there. Very friendly and patient.   The food came out fairly quick. So it is totally doable to pull off the road and eat and leave in 10 mins.  Keeps the mess out of your car too.  

I was looking behind the counter and it's a really wide selection back there.  Like there is a sort of hidden fully stocked back there with 4 beers on tap.  Strange but I'm talking a lot of booze.  Not sure when that comes into play but they have it.  Also a jukebox and a video poker machine.

1,"You know, strip mall dining takes a lot of abuse but when you find a place this awesome, it makes up for the bad experiences. 

If you've never experienced Ethiopian cuisine, be prepared to step out of your comfort zone. Silverware is not used and it's not even needed. 

They have a good selection of meat as well as vegetarian dishes. We went with the vegetarian sampler which is unbelievably big. Just take the left overs to the drive-in movie like we're doing tonight. 

It was very cold in there and I'm not sure if that is normal so you might want to prepare for it. It is 57 degrees in Addis Ababa as I'm writing this review and that's probably what it was in the restaurant. I guess that helps with the authenticity!","Now THIS is what I'm talking about, Indy. Let's get creative. 

If you only visited the front of this place, you might think it's a pretty cool bar with a good beer selection, awesome artwork, and killer tacos. I would give it five stars for that alone. 

But wait...

There is a freaking tiki bar in the back! Consider my mind blown.","Text1: You know, strip mall dining takes a lot of abuse but when you find a place this awesome, it makes up for the bad experiences.

Before crossing the Huey P was a nerve wracking event. Narrow lanes combined with unskilled drivers results in stress, panic, and road rage. The new, improved bridge is much, much better than it used to be. No longer do I fear death while driving over it! How's that for an endorsement?","The Fudgery is located in the Riverwalk, which means the prices are inflated. But man is the fudge delicious. The staff does a great job interacting with customers while making the fudge while everyone watches. They sing and have an interesting patter involving the customers, drawing in people walking by.

But the real star is the fudge itself. It's sold by the pound and each block is approximately 1/2 a pound. It comes in a number of flavors and we discovered that if you buy three pieces you get one free! We picked up dark chocolate with nuts, rocky road, peanut butter & chocolate, and ""excellent chocolate"". 

The peanut butter & chocolate fudge is amazing, like a premium Reese's cup. The dark chocolate with nuts is amazing, as is the rocky road. Even the plain chocolate is really good fudge. If you're in the Riverwalk anyway, be sure to stop and get some.","Text1: Amazing how construction changes everything.

1,"We stopped in on a whim on a busy Saturday night for a light bite of dinner.   Usually Italian is not the place for a light bite, but here they make it work very well.  The scene is kind of upscale/casual if there is such a thing.   The appearance is classy, but the place is loud and really has a kind of fun, neighborhood vibe.  If your neighborhood is Ladue, that is.  
We had the good fortune of sitting at the bar for a few minutes next to a talkative self-described barfly.  She was pretty darn thrilled to have a chance to walk us through the menu, and that's fine with us. Turns out she's a very regular who works next door I addition to being a great Giovanni's ambassador.  

Now we have been to Giovanni's on the Hill, but that was waaay more of a special occasion restaurant.  We were happy with the food there, but not so much the art museum hushed-tones ambience.  Somewhere between is their Il Bel Lago, so this restaurant is a nice addition to their lineup.  I think it's casual enough where it would work just about anywhere.  
We split a salad called Burrata al Pomodoro and had two small pastas; Casoncelli and cannelloni.  The large and small portions were perfect for us.  All three of these dishes were not just good, but were all pretty special.   A couple of warnings, though:  the Casoncelli has a very strong mushroom flavor and the small size cannelloni was small than a lot of tapas I've had, maybe half the size of my palm.   Again, though, the tastes were pretty fantastic.  

If Ladue wasn't over the river and through the woods, we might become barflies ourselves.","The wife and I stopped in at Cyrano's for a late night drink and snack.  Although it was a pretty ugly night, the place was hopping.  We sat at a pub table back by the coffee bar and they were seriously cranking out some hot drinks and lots of whipped cream.   The biggest question about Cyrano's is ""What the hell is it?""

When you drive by, and even when you walk in, you get the feeling your in a trendy, upscale restaurant.  Then they hand you a menu and on its owne it looks like you might be at a Waffle House or something - very casual looking.  Upon closer inspection, though, there are not a ton of items, but they are definitely way too interesting to be at any kind of chain restaurant.  There is also a pretty extensive menu for coffee drinks and desserts, which we just ignored, and a pretty decent wine list.  The bar looks like a counter, almost as if they are embarrassed to have a full bar.  The ambience, while having an upscale appearance, is still very lively.   We weren't sure if it was the acoustics, or what, but this was a very loud crowd.   For anyone who has been to the Benton Park Cafe, Cryano's is what they are trying to be and doing a much better job of it. 

We had a couple glasses of wine by the glass and spinach-artichoke dip.  All was very good.   We won't hesistate to come back for a date sometime and try the main courses.  If it was more convenient, I have a feeling we might become regulars.  Cool place.  Give it a try.","Text1: We stopped in on a whim on a busy Saturday night for a light bite of dinner.

You can't beat a cheap meal, and especially one that's prepared with obviously fresh vegetables! My husband picked up our dinner right before I got off from work, but it's so cold outside we had to reheat them - thankfully the microwave didn't ruin anything. He got the beef and I opted just for the vegetables, both of which came with an egg. The variety of veggies is great, but most importantly they are clearly fresh, not frozen or canned, and it makes a huge difference with bibimbap. The sauces were good, but I felt like the veggie one lacked a little bit on flavors. Spicy level was minimal when you mixed everything together, so I ended up adding more for myself. We will certainly be back for more yummy, healthy, and quick takeout from this super cute spot!","OMG the calzone with prosciutto..... HEAVEN.

1,Nice little spot in a very unexpected little plaza. We started with the lamb tartare which was yummy with the little pieces of cut up beet. I had the fish tacos which were just ok but I should have asked what kind of fish came on them because it was salmon which I'm not a huge fan of and had I asked i would have ordered something else. The toppings were great but salmon just isn't my fave. We also had an order of chicken tenders and the fried chicken (thigh) sandwich which were all delicious. Our server was great and overall a cool spot. I'd def give it another go.,We came in for dinner on a Monday night. The place is small but nice. They were short staffed so the service was a bit slow but I expect it would be great any other night. The food was good and on the smaller side portion wise but the pricing was fair. I'd probably go back.,"Text1: Nice little spot in a very unexpected little plaza. We started with the lamb tartare which was yummy with the little pieces of cut up beet.

1,"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. We live about 30 minutes away so called ahead for seating. We were told 65 minutes. We arrived about 5 minutes before our quoted tone and checked in at the station. They said it would be another 10 minutes. We were fine with that so waited. We watched one family come in and get several bags of peanuts and at least 5 baskets of rolls. They were sitting outside chowing down!  After 30 minutes passed I finally asked how much longer. I saw people who checked in after us being sat before us. They had skipped over us but said it would be soon. We had to toddlers in our party door was getting a bit ridiculous waiting so long. Finally we sat and our server was decent. We ordered margaritas and the blooming onion style appetizer. The drinks were good, the onion was terrible! Even the sauce was bad, no one really ate much of it. We then ordered chicken for the kids and the rest of us had steaks. My steak was very rare when ordered medium. They were able to fix it pretty quick. Of course it came out closer to well that time but  at least it wasn't bleeding still. The flavor was delicious. Our bill was $130 so not too bad for a part of 7. It was only 4 adult meals, we all had 6 ounce sirloin and it was very tender.  We did have issues getting drunk refills but it was busy. We asked 3-5 times before drinks really showed up. We will try them again on a not so busy night. Hopefully they can be more prompt with their seating & service.","Kind of an older person hang out. This is especially true in the season. Its not horrible but its one of those places who puts you on the salad bar to postpone the slow dinner. I have been here several times.

They were sitting outside chowing down!  After 30 minutes passed I finally asked how much longer. I saw people who checked in after us being sat before us. They had skipped over us but said it would be soon. We had to toddlers in our party door was getting a bit ridiculous waiting so long. Finally we sat and our server was decent. We ordered margaritas and the blooming onion style appetizer. The drinks were good, the onion was terrible! Even the sauce was bad, no one really ate much of it. We then ordered chicken for the kids and the rest of us had steaks. My steak was very rare when ordered medium. They were able to fix it pretty quick. Of course it came out closer to well that time but  at least it wasn't bleeding still. The flavor was delicious. Our bill was $130 so not too bad for a part of 7. It was only 4 adult meals, we all had 6 ounce sirloin and it was very tender.  We did have issues getting drunk refills but it was busy. We asked 3-5 times before drinks really showed up. We will try them again on a not so busy night. Hopefully they can be more prompt with their seating & service. 

 Text2: Kind of an older person hang out. This is especially true in the season. Its not horrible but its one of those places who puts you on the salad bar to postpone the slow dinner. I have been here several times. I have had pasta....NOT.....Also pork chops, Horrible and tough. The chicken Marsala was actually good and it did come with pasta. It is a big place and has a decent selection. It just seems a bit of a place where your grandparents would enjoy hanging out.",yes
0,It's basically a mini-mall of upscale national small retail stores (but there is Brown Betty cupcakes located down one of the corridors) and a food court. But there are some redeeming things like Canstuction and other events (see my pictures) that they hold in the rotunda now and then.,"Coral hooked it up with a $50 cut and color. At first I was sceptical about the price because as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for,"" but that wasn't the case. I knew of Coral when she was at Sinful Salon and she always did a great job. I did blonde bangs and burgundy for the rest. My hair came out phenomenal! I get so many compliments on it. My ends were really damaged from all the coloring I do so sadly she had to cut them off, but she offers a product for hair growth or eyelash growth of you want longer eyelashes. Their prices are VERY fair. The also do nails, make up and eye brows. Highly recommend you going in to see Coral for your hair needs!

Again exiting the conference for an extended break as the City of Nashville's humidity finally gave way to rain, it was perhaps an oversight of Vanderbilt's love of a boozy brunch that saw us arrive at Tavern to the tune of a 90-minute wait, the time largely spent wandering nearby Centennial Park beneath umbrellas until a text called us forth from the Pantheon to be seated amongst a mass of humanity with well lubricated co-eds screaming to be heard above the loud tunes echoing from high ceilings overhead.

Dining with a pair of ladies from the era which several of the restaurant's 1960s tunes were sourced, and thus clearly not of a demographic common during the hour of our meal, suffice it to say that the ninety minute wait was further compromised by overstretched service that saw our table ignored until a manager was flagged down fifteen minutes later, the kitchen itself equally stressed but trying to make good by sending out four scoops of luke-warm ""White Trash Hash"" as the wait-time for plates was extended another twenty-five minutes after the order was eventually placed.

Already aware that my memory of the experience would be marred by the aforementioned events no matter how good the cuisine, it was unsurprising that when all items were brought out at once there was evidence of a good bit of heat-lamp treatment to found and although the Kaya Toast was actually quite impressive in its balance of textures as well as flavors despite the unnecessary decorative hot sauce, the biscuits were leaden and far too soggy, the supposed cheddar almost undetectable beneath gravy that tasted little of spice and closer to oversalted ham.

Unable to pass on sweets, but unaware that the ""fondue"" featured both Red Velvet and Blueberry waffles since the later was not amongst the menu items listed, it was with an unnecessary plate of the crispy cornmeal checkerboard that the meal progressed and faring far better than the doughy red velvet iteration which lacked any semblance of coco suffice it to say that any suggestion of 'cardamom' in the 'maple' syrup was so faint as to be imperceptible, the snappy spiced sausage and cornflake crusted French Toast saving the otherwise lackluster shared plate.

Informed that desserts are only offered at dinner, and as such going even sweeter than usual with mains, it was finally the restaurant's thinly poured flapjacks that crossed our lips and although a better effort could have been made than a topping of pretzels straight from a bag it would be difficult to find any other fault in the buttermilk triplet, the sticky-sweet caramel finding an unexpectedly willing dancing partner in light chocolate mousse that produced a flavor not unlike that of tres leches as it soaked the pancakes straight down to the plate.","I  came here for lunch one afternoon looking forward to trying it and left hungry because I lost my appetite mid meal and here is why: 

I unrolled my silverware and there was cheese encrusted all over the fork to where the prongs were not even visible. Ok, strike one but not the worst I've seen so lets just grab another fork and move on.  

I make my way over to the buffet which was fried chicken and red beans and rice and I've heard good things about it so I was looking forward to trying it. They had quasi clean plates stacked on top of buffet line so I grab one and notice that there is rice matted onto the plate.

0,"I hate to do this, but I just didn't enjoy this place as the other reviewers have. 

We waited for about 1.5 hours to get seated. Upon seating inside, I automatically lost the ability to hear any person I was with at all. The music literally screams in your ear, a bit much for a Sunday morning. The decorations are neat, but it's very crowded inside. 

I had no idea what to order. It's all quite unfamiliar. I wish there were more breakfast options. I ordered a waffle with apricots on top. I knew from the moment that I saw it, I was going to leave hungry. Don't get me wrong, the waffle was delicious, but I wanted a little bit more for a $10 waffle. 

I wasn't wowed.","I hate when I read a 5-star review for a place that has an average of 3 stars and the review starts like this: ""I can't believe this place has such negative reviews!!!""

That being said, I can't believe this place has such negative reviews!!! (sorry)

I ate here for the first time last night and had no complaints. I've never ordered delivery from them or been in when it was busy so I can't speak to that. The service was great, they kept checking on me to see if I needed anything. When I'd finish a glass of wine they'd notice and ask if I wanted another.

The pizza was the best I've had in NOLA, honestly. I got the Queens pizza so it was a ""white"" pizza, with olive oil instead of tomato sauce. The crust was so thin and crispy! I asked for a side of tomato sauce to dip the crust in and the tomato sauce was awesome...so sweet and good.

I've only been to New York once and I don't remember if I had pizza or not so I can't tell you if NYP is authentically New York, but whatever it is I loved it. It was casual, too. I love how us New Orleanians take our food seriously, but sometimes I feel like every place is a tad too upscale for me. Like, I couldn't just walk in wearing sweatshirt and some sweatpants. Sometimes it's nice to be able to do that...here I didn't feel like that would be an issue. I'm not saying it's a dive, but it's just a tad more laid back than other pizza places close by. To me, that's a plus.

This will be my go-to pizza joint from now on.","Text1: I hate to do this, but I just didn't enjoy this place as the other reviewers have.

I have visited on several occasions and will continue to shop at Sprouts for produce and bulk items.

My favorite section in the store is by far their bulk items.  *pro tip* make sure you use the labels and pens provided to write the plu number for the product.  I've seen several customers skip this step.  They offer some of the best chocolate covered pretzels EVER! I love the granola, dried beans, etc. I enjoy shopping here, and look forward to many more visits.","I absolutely loved the atmosphere here! I've had this restaurant bookmarked for several months with the anticipation that it would be typical bar or Tavern fare and sports bar like atmosphere so I wasn't in a hurry to visit.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved everything from the comfy seating arrangements to the very approachable menu choices.  I can most definitely see myself bringing many friends and family here when visiting from out of town.

1,"Oaks Italian is a pizzeria offering the usual mix of pizza,  hot and cold sandwiches (try the Italian pork with provelone) and related items as well as some Italian dishes.  The interior is nice, but seating is limited and can become crowded at meal time.  Outdoor seating is available, but provides a view of a busy intersection.  Service is usually good, and food generally arrives pretty quickly.  Prices are average.  Occasionally, the small parking lot behind the restaurant will fill, requiring patrons to park across a busy street and walk back.","Fellini Cafe is a wonderful small Italian restaurant. Two of us had pasta for lunch, with a salad and bruschetta to start. Service was snappy: from being seated to the delivery of our food, we did not wait long.

The food itself was delightful. Of the dishes we ordered, we loved all 4 and the only thing I could criticize (and this is trivial) is that I felt there was too much tomato on the bruschetta.

Service was patient and friendly. Our water glasses were refilled attentively. The staff were cheery and genuinely concerned that we were happy. For context, we arrive immediately after a party of at least 10 had just been seated, yet we received excellent service.

The dining area was nicely decorated and quite clean.

Not the healthiest choices obviously, but if only bar food will do this hits the spot.","The first time I was here, it was a little crowded and I was the first to arrive for a party of 6. They didn't act like this was a problem at all and moved a few tables around to seat us, then right after we ordered a larger, more comfortable table opened and they moved us over. They acted like they were inconveniencing us and apologized a million times, then sent over an order of rock shrimp tempura on the house.

I also shared the special roll of the day and some tuna and avocado rolls, and everything was really fresh and satisfying. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy what they ordered and the service was great. I just made a reservation to go back for my birthday!


UPDATE: My birthday was an amazing success. Our server was so sweet and again the fish was so fresh and beautiful. This time the rock shrimp tempura was served in a wasabi aioli and was even better than last time. Also they are participating in foie gras week, and one of my friends did order that dish - I didn't try it but everyone who did seemed to like it.

0,"Really liked the style and the food concept. Just strongly recommend getting there early for premium parking!

After eating and the whole experience, spoke to the group and we all agreed the mood was somber in the place, the food was bland, it took a long time to get all the orders out from first to last, place gave you a feeling of being claustrophobic (only 4 groups of tables) so either you got intimate or like most people you just stand hovering over everyone waiting to take food out.

For $10, the size was meager and nothing special I could not make at home...  So not sure about our return.

From the experience, the parking, the hovering, and the time variability between orders would prevent me from returning.  That being said, if I was in area and it wasn't busy I would go back and ask for extra seasonings and some salt...

1,"It's a diner.  They serve diner food.  You can guess the rest.  If you want breakfast any time of day, this is one of your choices.

Downfall: the scrapple. They took a thick slice of scrapple and dunked it in the deep fryer so that it puffed up.  It wasn't good scrapple to begin with, and the deep-frying only made it worse. (For those who turn their nose up at scrapple: yes, there is a difference in scrapple quality. See Kraftwork for the high end of the scrapple spectrum.)

Aside from the scrapple, everything else was just fine here.  The breakfast special was very reasonably priced.  But some loud regulars who seemed to think that everyone else wanted to hear about their exciting lives were rather annoying.","Imagine movie theaters from the Golden Era, with a big neon marquee.

Downfall: the scrapple. They took a thick slice of scrapple and dunked it in the deep fryer so that it puffed up.  It wasn't good scrapple to begin with, and the deep-frying only made it worse. (For those who turn their nose up at scrapple: yes, there is a difference in scrapple quality. See Kraftwork for the high end of the scrapple spectrum.)

Aside from the scrapple, everything else was just fine here.  The breakfast special was very reasonably priced.  But some loud regulars who seemed to think that everyone else wanted to hear about their exciting lives were rather annoying.

The theaters themselves have nice screens and good sound.   This particular location also has 3D and IMAX movies which is nice.  The parking lot is pretty big and it's easy to get to from Rt 38.

Overall, I wouldn't expect to find an indie movie your looking for at this location, but if you want to catch a blockbuster or main stream flick, this is the spot for you.","You had me at ""bacon sampler.""

I can't believe I never noticed this place before.  Probably because it's nestled in the corner of a busy strip mall with the looming shadow of PJ Whelans across the street.  Harry's blows PJs out of the water though.

We went for a work lunch, so I couldn't try any of the beer, but I must say that the tap list was very impressive.  

For food we all tried the burgers with different toppings.  My friend went with the donut burger which he liked and I went with the cheese, bacon, and peanut butter burger.  It was out of this world other than being a little overcooked for my liking.  

The best part was the bacon sampler.  Market price.  4 types of bacon to try.  It was enough for the 4 of us at the table to try a bit of each.  All different and delicious.

This is a strip mall so there is a fair amount of parking, but don't even dare parking over here and trying to walk across the street to PJs.  They are serious about that!","Text1: Just your basic chain movie theater.  Huge crowds at night and on weekends.  Overpriced food and expensive tickets.

0,"Pros: 
-When we arrived at 10am there was still a wait but it was only a few minutes.
-Cash only but the ATM fee is only $1.75. 
-Our waiter took care of us pretty well, even though he seemed quite busy. That's OK, he still brought out everything we asked for and much faster than we expected. 
-The house coffee, orange juice (fresh squeezed!), and sweet potato fries are fantastic. We brought some champagne with us and enjoyed our newly converted mimosas.

Cons: 
-This place is really small. A gentleman had to get up so I could get to my seat. If I didn't scoot all the way in, the person behind me wouldn't be able to sit, and I am not a big person. 
-Our entrees weren't that impressive. Egg scramble was good. Bacon stack was good. Made with good ingredients. My stomach felt good. But I could have easily made the bacon stack at home (slices of bread, bacon, and eggs) instead of paying $9. 

Based on previous reviews, Ants Pants seemed to have improved their service and they are more consistent with their beverages. At the same time, I get why people said it wasn't memorable. I'll be back for the coffee and the sweet potato fries - to go.","It's regular date-night cost... under 22 dollars for an entree, under 11 for an appetizer. 6-8ish for drinks? 6 for dessert.

All our food was very good. I got a soup, but it was 9 dollars I think- ouch. Not the best soup, I guess. but the pumpkin empanadas app was AWESOME, about the size of two perogies for 9 dollars... but yummy.
Entrees are a pretty appropriate meal size. Lots of seasoning in all their food.

We also got a flan which was a little different than regular flan--- they tell you the syrup is bittersweet. More bitter than sweet. It is a genuine burnt taste of caramel sauce. Not my fave.

We also tried their Vampira beverage... a bizarre take on the tequila bloody mary that we decided was good. It tastes like they added worcester shire sauce or something... it reminds me of venison marinade. You might want to get one to share with someone to try it.

Service was sort of awkward. And it's cold in there in the wintertime, so of course they put you next to the window. Just ask to move, they understand. Asking for personal opinions helps the staff warm up to you, instead of seeming dissatisfied with their job. A bit slow, though.

The place is beautifully decorated with all hand-made decor  from mexico, including the tables, chairs, custom dishes, curtains, photographs.","Text1: Pros:

Have you ever had a place in your town that you are actually proud of and love recommending to friends and family, well Pi is that place for me. Ever since they first opened I have been a huge fan of their cornmeal deep dish crust pizza, it is ever so sweet without being too much. The toppings are another thing entirely, high quality toppings on top of their thick/chunky tomato sauce. I have to admit however I am not a fan of tomatoes, yet this sauce is amazing. It all comes together perfectly for an amazing pizza that is far superior to the Chicago style deep dish pizza. Next is the thin cruise which is just as good, however it uses a slightly different sauce, but is equally as good.

The atmosphere at each pie is very unique and casual while somehow maintaining an intimate experience. I love this place, amazing pizza and an atmosphere to match.","Cafe Provencal is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time.  A few years ago, I was lucky enough to travel the Provence area of France for two weeks, and  truly miss it.  Cafe Provence invokes memories of my travels, as the food is fantastic and is true to the wonderful food I had while in France.  My only wish is that they would add 'moules et frites' to the menu. 

The staff is wonderfully friendly and the surroundings are fine.  The food is delicious, and from the smells coming from the other tables, it doesn't matter what you order as it will all be good.  I ordered the porc grille [pork loin], and my husband got the strip steak.  Both were savory and fantastic.","Text1: First off let me just say I am a little late with my review of Pi, however I have been a regular since they first opened.

0,"This may be a Yelp first for me--writing a review for a supermarket. But--this review is really all about the gooey butter cake--a STL phenomenon that was unbeknownst to me until recently.

A friend told me that Schnucks sells this cake, so I went to go check it out. Dang, it is good. A brownie-type of chewy consistency, and it truly tastes like--well, a gooey butter cake!

Worth coming to Schnucks alone for this. :-)","I've been wanting to come here for a while because a) I'm infatuated with British things and miss living in London with all its cozy pubs and b) there are a bunch of delicious-looking vegetarian items on the menu. So I met up with a friend here on Sunday and we had lunch and played some Wizard of Oz Fluxx (a card game) with the dice expansion. By the way, the tables work quite well for card/dice games, in case you're curious; it's an important aspect of a pub!

I was a bit disappointed by the food, however. I ordered a smoked gouda and apple sandwich because I enjoy both of those elements, and the homemade potato chips. But the sandwich was overcooked and a bit burnt (otherwise I can tell it would've been great, because smoked gouda is the best). The chips (crisps, as they'd be called in Britain) were just not good. I still ate a bunch of them, thinking they would get better, but I think they were unseasoned or overcooked or both, because they were a bit bitter, not crispy, and had no positive flavor that I could tell to them. Was I supposed to add table salt? I don't know, I've never had to salt potato chips before, they generally come pre-seasoned, unless they're concerned about sodium content. Also, the waitress took quite a while to come back and check on us after we got our food.

1,"I'm between a 2 and 3 star rating for Old Standard. It's not a place I'd visit again unless someone else was really pushing for it.

What was good:

Fried pickles! Why no one has thought to batter and fry bread-and-butter pickles before is beyond me, but this place does it and they were pretty darn good.

Fun sodas! House-made flavors like double cream, pumpkin spice, and some other options. 

Unfortunately, this place is not named ""Old Standard Fried Pickles and Fun Sodas"", or it'd be a 4-star establishment. It's named for fried chicken. And the fried chicken was not good. 

I have no problem paying the $11 or whatever for 2 pieces of chicken, a side and a biscuit if it's extra special and super delicious. I liked that you can pick any two pieces you want. That's a nice touch. The mac n' cheese was A-OK, as was the biscuit. But I can't get over how bad the chicken was. 

The pieces were over-fried and super dried out. I got the leg and breast, and gave up after one bite of the breast. The breading cracked and fell off in hard, super crunchy pieces. Nothing tasted seasoned or marinated. No one could ever call this chicken juicy or  even greasy, which would have been better than what was served. It was so, so overdone. I don't know how it made it out of the kitchen like that. If you're a chicken place, you've got to be good at chicken.

In this brave new world of paying $15 for things like fried chicken and ramen, I've upped my standards. Unfortunately, Old Standard fell below mine.","I'll preface with the ""there's no shame in getting three stars"" caveat. I had brunch at Home Wine Kitchen this morning and it was A-OK. Not knock-your-socks off good, but not bad either. 

We went after noon, so there was no trouble finding a seat. We opted for a high-top table, and I thought it was plenty comfortable. 

My friend wanted a Bloody Mary, but nothing too spicy. They only serve their house mix, which our server warned would probably be on the peppier side. Grateful for the warning, my friend asked if they served fresh-squeezed orange juice. No. But they are working on it, so that's nice to know. 

It would be nice if the brunch menu listed out some more beverage options than just the mimosa or bloody mary. Do you have lattes or just coffee? Juice? Sodas? 

For a starter, we had the cinnamon bread. The topping was lovely and had a great flavor, but the bread itself was just ok. For entrees, I had the eggs benedict and my friend went with the steak and eggs. 

The eggs benedict: 3.5 stars. The eggs were poached perfectly. I liked the crispy spinach and the buttered ciabatta or whatever toasty bread they put everything on. It came with a deceptive amount of prosciutto. I really liked it, but at the end I had a big pile of it left over. I was not a fan of the brown butter hollandaise. It didn't look appealing the way it was squirted on the dish and I wasn't crazy about the flavor. There was something spicy that kind of turned me off. But on the whole -- it is a solid dish. 

I can't comment on the steak and eggs, as I only tried a little piece of the carpaccio. My friend enjoyed it. 

I felt the portions were generous for the price. The service was excellent. My coffee and water were always full. Also, those little clear jars for the sugar are a nice touch. 

All that said, I don't think this is somewhere I would think to come back to when I'm craving brunch. Everything was fine and good, but nothing really stood out to be crave-worthy. 

I'm going to give them a try for dinner, which is where I'm sure their biggest strengths lie.","Text1: I'm between a 2 and 3 star rating for Old Standard. It's not a place I'd visit again unless someone else was really pushing for it.

He cut me off and continued talking about how the company usually doesn't do any deliveries after 5pm despite being able to schedule this time with the company beforehand. I ended the phone call flustered and having pushed my time to 4:15pm to suit the needs of this delivery person.

Hearing of my situation, the gift sender complained to management who responded that they do, in fact, deliver after 5pm. Surprise, surprise. This employee was simply trying to get off work early. When the package finally arrived, the fruit was fine, but...let's talk about the balloon.

This was the saddest balloon I have ever seen in my life. It sings, but it was COMPLETELY deflated, despite the delivery person's assurance that it was simply due to the cold. No. This balloon had a hole in it. I photographed it for Yelp and for my own dry humor. 

Never again. I'll make my own chocolate-covered strawberries, thank you.","Text1: Came here for lunch one friday and was pleasantly surprised.  I am not a big fan of its sister restaurant the Cheesecake Factory, so I didn't really know what to expect. 
For an appetizer we had the Volcano Shrimp which was absolutely delicious (think Bonefish Grille's Bang Bang Shrimp).
I ordered the manhattan chopped salad and it was an all-around perfect balance.

I can't wait to take my family although i'd hope for better service next time. The waitress was a little unattentive for not being busy.

1,"Really great for the price, but nothing blew me away in awesomeness.

We tried the Tokyo Tower, which was very interesting and surprisingly quite tasty. It had some raw tuna, rice, apple slices, and cucumber, with thin fried potato chips on top! I never would have tried it if my boyfriend hadn't been insistent on trying something random and new.

We also got the Sunset roll which didn't sound very appealing but a friend kept telling us it was great, and I'm glad we branched out because it was pretty good. The dragon roll had slightly over-cooked unagi which was rather disappointing. The crunch roll was very crunchy and ideal, but nothing that special.

I do love that this place serves soup and salad with your meal, even at dinner on a Saturday night! I don't think most other places can beat that. Although I didn't care for the soup (very salty) or the salad (too much dressing), the touch was appreciated.

The service is also fairly good, although there's a waiter in particular who constantly tried to take our plates before we were finished. Our friend warned us about him and he was right! My boyfriend concluded that maybe they let him eat people's leftovers and that's why he's so hell-bent on taking our food away! Who knows.

It's nice to have a good sushi place so close to us but I have yet to find my favorite in StL.","I came here in a group and they were very nice about accommodating all of us. I loved their basil ginger lemonade, which had just the right amount of sugar.
We shared a bunch of appetizers and two pizzas and everything was rather tasty. I enjoyed the meatballs too! Nothing was particularly memorable but it was a pleasant time and the patio looks like a lovely place to chill on a spring/summer night.","Text1: Really great for the price, but nothing blew me away in awesomeness.

1,"No, not again! Does the line ever end, will I ever make it to the front of the line? Will they get my order right today? How long is this going to take? Do I really want to bother? YES!!!!
I know the lines are miserable, but you do get to the front. I have learned to try & watch them make our order, so I can try to stop it, if it is incorrect. If it's wrong, they just do it again.
Why is it worth this terror? Because it tastes so darn good. It's not called Twistee Treat by accident. The ice cream is always creamy and good, no matter how you order it.
When going, just remember to put on your adult pants on & be willing to stand up for your ice cream fix.
What's a girl to do? Ice cream makes everyone happy, so enjoy & be happy.","What can I say when you break down in the rain, ya gotta be glad to see a smiling face. My driver was terrific!  My car is my baby and I broke down in a second floor parking deck, with a very narrow & windy ( I mean steep curves) & a medium in the center & a wall on the narrow sides.
Definitely  not the optimal place to break down. The driver very quickly earned my trust & in the rain maneuvered by car out of the lot & down the long winding narrow slope. The slope is a blast in the car, but under these circumstances  took an expert that took his job seriously.
Action towing has some top not drivers to pull this maneuver  off. Then in rush hour traffic, we were off to the other side of town, where my mechanic is. Friendly, professional & personalised service is what I received. A great job, I wish I could remember  my drivers name, as he is the best!
Highly recommend Action towing to anyone!

0,"First off I want to give kudos to all the amazing people that volunteer their time at Telus World Of Science :-) The place looks immaculate and you would be hard pressed to find somebody where if you stopped them to ask a question they wouldn't  have an answer for you.

With that being said however I just got back from my first visit to the Telus since they brought in this new concept of upcharging admission for their ""feature exhibits"" and I have to say I was really disappointed with the experience. We walked through the whole body works exhibit reading 90% of the informational plaques on the cases and walls in half an hour and I really don't feel that it justified adding an extra $10.00 to the price of the general admission.

There is two exhibits at the Telus ""Mystery Avenue"" and ""The Body Fantastic"" that have been there a number of years and when you walk through them you really feel that they have outlived their usefulness. Body Fantastic has a number of things in it that look worn out and need maintenance and Mystery Avenue amusingly enough has video footage with news personalities that haven't been on television in quite some time. I think it is also worth mentioning that the explorer gallery upstairs is currently sitting empty without an exhibit.

There are a number of great shows in the Imax right now and thankfully a healthy offering of 8 different shows playing in the Margaret Zeidler star theatre. The star theatre shows are included in the price of general admission and definetly worth a look.

It's a great place to take kids for fun and interactive learning but just not a venue in th city that promotes repeat visits I think. If the city was smart it would put some money into the Telus to breathe new life into it and stop spending money on stupid sculptures to put on the corner of Fox Drive and the Whytemud but that will never happen until we get rid of Stephen ""WE NEED A NEW ARENA"" Mandel.","We've been here 4 times and only get the beef burrito with cheese sauce AND green sauce, and the cheese chili relleno (it's not breaded...possibly the best I've had anywhere) with green sauce.  Absolutely excellent with friendly service.  I was also drawn to the alcohol free strawberry daiquiris!!!","Text1: First off I want to give kudos to all the amazing people that volunteer their time at Telus World Of Science :-) The place looks immaculate and you would be hard pressed to find somebody where if you stopped them to ask a question they wouldn't  have an answer for you.

0,"A pretty small place right around the corner of 16th and spruce. It's a good place to get Thai take out. I forget what I got exactly, but it was damn good. 14 bucks was worth the meal and a half that I received. Very satisfied. The owner/manager was very nice too.","I read a bunch of reviews before going, so I was prepared for the wait and delicious food. I got both, just as planned. The wait wasn't too bad for just a two-top, about 15 minutes. The eggs benedict was everything they said it would be. I added a potato latke because everyone kept raving about it and it was delicious (although, it's hard to fry a potato and make it not delicious to me!) with a necessary side of apple sauce and sour cream- yum! 

I can definitely see what all the hype is about. I like the benches outside for waiting if it's nice weather and they have outdoor seating, which is always a plus. The inside was quite small, but in a nice way, very Philly-ish. If you've been a fan of Sabrina's in the Italian Market, I get the same vibe from this place (although the patrons are more hipster here). I think the service here is better than most. They were friendlier and really on top of their game here. I'd def. go back!

1,"With cork floors, frosted glass and soft lighting, the studio here is absolutely serene - you can't help but feel a little more peaceful as soon as you walk in the door. The space is well thought out, with plenty of room for coats and shoes, an organized area for props, and a welcoming entryway with lots of light. 

The staff are a happy, relaxed, wonderful bunch; all of them have that sincerely radiant demeanor that seems to occur only in yoga professionals and people who have just hiked the Appalachian Trail or something. I've taken a lot of classes with Robyn, whose sessions are challenging yet light-hearted. She always offers new perspectives and different ways to approach the postures, and she's great at reading the class's energy and building a practice to suit that moment.

With Whole Foods next door and Percy St. across the way, it's easy to keep yourself occupied around here. But when you're feeling the need to shrug off the busy city and turn your focus inward, Yoga Child is a lovely place to recharge.","Village Whiskey is small and intimate, with quintessential ""Philadelphia bar"" trappings like a tin ceiling and subway tiles. Big windows give it a much brighter feel than other such spaces, and the wall of whiskeys behind the bar is something to behold. Seating is at the bar or in tall, comfortable leather booths, and the Prohibition-esque soundtrack playing in the background adds to the atmosphere.

Whiskey! This place has lots and lots and lots of whiskey. They also have a good beer list and a bunch of the updated old-timey cocktails that I'm so happy to see popping up all over the place. Boyfriend and I opted for a fancypants version of a beer and a shot - Lagunitas Czech Pils and Sixpoints Righteous Rye, and Four Roses single batch for him and Rowan Creek (a smooth, vanilla-y bourbon) for me. 

Having visited on their second day open, I anticipated some of the usual new-restaurant service issues, but everything ran quite smoothly, and our waiter was gracious and quick to find answers for all our questions.The extensive whiskey list, many of which were unfamiliar (did I see a scotch called Inchmuffin?), led me to ask for guidance, and I appreciated that the waiter took my criteria to the bartender for a solid recommendation from someone who knows all the whiskeys, rather than guessing at something he hadn't tried. 

The menu is small and burger-heavy - the opposite of tapas. I needn't have worried, though, because it turns out that Jose Garces can do the whole upscale bar food thing just as well as Spanish small plates. For vegetarians, the house-made veggie burger is dense and hearty, with black beans and edamame, and I liked it with Jasper Hill cheddar that was good enough to eat off a plate at Tria. The fresh, airy sesame roll is a treat, too.

Although duck fat fries are on the menu, the server told me that they're happy to do fries in olive oil for veggies. I skirted the issue by ordering tater tots, which are really way too good to be called by the same name as the brown lumps in school cafeterias. These are fried just right, crispy and golden, warm and smooth inside, and seasoned perfectly. 

You can get all kinds of pickled things here - tomatoes, baby carrots - and the regular old cucumber pickles were fresh and fantastic. 

By this point I was feeling pretty done, but the dessert menu contained a phrase that stopped me in my tracks: BRULEED WHISKEY FLUFF. Ladies and gentlemen of Yelp, believe me, you want to eat bruleed whiskey fluff. It comes with homemade graham crackers and chocolate ganache to make a whiskey-fied smores, and man, it is awesome stuff.

I predict that Village Whiskey will be absolutely packed on the weekends from here on out; it's a great addition to the Garces empire on the best restaurant block in the city.","Text1: With cork floors, frosted glass and soft lighting, the studio here is absolutely serene - you can't help but feel a little more peaceful as soon as you walk in the door.

1,"The first time I went, I didn't know what to expect. My friends wanted to do some archery and try it out for our first time. 
There is a lot of parking, but its tricky turning into this complex.
Basically, you rent a lane ($12) and a recurve bow and 3 arrows ($6) and stay as long as you like. If it's your first time here, they will take you through a safety demonstration and access you for a left or right recurve bow. You will also be given a target sheet to hang at the end of the lane. You can shoot when everyone is at the shooting line and it's safe to do so.
The staff at Wyld Archery are very knowledgeable and are always helpful anytime you have a question. 
I didn't think I would like archery this much, but I started to really enjoy it after a few more times coming here. It has challenged me to be more focus and its also a very inspirational sport.
I decided to continue learning archery,  so I bought a 15 session pass. (Comes out to be $6 a session).
There are a lot of regulars that come here to target practice and many of them are always willing to help you and give you pointers if you ask. 
This is a very down to earth place and the people here are very easy going. You'll really enjoy doing archery here, especially for beginners.
It's a good focus exercise and you get to work on your shoulders as well.","Nothing is as amazing as going for a 8-10 course meal at Dynasty either for a Charity Event or a Wedding when you haven't eaten all day long. It's really fun and exciting here when they have there parties. There's a area to set up for the performers and speakers, a dance floor, and an area for volunteers to set up there own whatevers. They have enough space for whatever you think of you need to do. I especially like the entrance area where they have a displace of floral arrangements and decor so you can take a simple picture. You can also do all your greeting and sorting out of arrangements because they give you enough space to do so. 
Once in awhile I come here for Dim Sum, but I'm usually here for the dinners. The food and the service here is mediocre, but what makes it up is the company of people gathering together to celebrate an event. Most of there dishes were flavorless and greasy, but the portion was significantly generous. Everyone always gets to bring a box of food home after. The fried rice and noodles were really plain and simple. The fish was little overcooked. The lobster didn't seem like it was killed on the spot... The Crispy Chicken was one of the better dishes. There's not really any food presentation here but they do bring the food out in a orderly fashion and on time as requested. Sometimes I overlook the fact that it's kinda uncomfortable to move around because they squish all the round tables together so it would fit everyone.

1,"Pros: 
-When we arrived at 10am there was still a wait but it was only a few minutes.
-Cash only but the ATM fee is only $1.75. 
-Our waiter took care of us pretty well, even though he seemed quite busy. That's OK, he still brought out everything we asked for and much faster than we expected. 
-The house coffee, orange juice (fresh squeezed!), and sweet potato fries are fantastic. We brought some champagne with us and enjoyed our newly converted mimosas.

Cons: 
-This place is really small. A gentleman had to get up so I could get to my seat. If I didn't scoot all the way in, the person behind me wouldn't be able to sit, and I am not a big person. 
-Our entrees weren't that impressive. Egg scramble was good. Bacon stack was good. Made with good ingredients. My stomach felt good. But I could have easily made the bacon stack at home (slices of bread, bacon, and eggs) instead of paying $9. 

Based on previous reviews, Ants Pants seemed to have improved their service and they are more consistent with their beverages. At the same time, I get why people said it wasn't memorable. I'll be back for the coffee and the sweet potato fries - to go.","FAN-TAS-TIC. From the ambiance to the staff to the FOOD, the experience was definitely worthwhile.  Our waiter was very courteous and we felt very welcomed the instant we stepped into the restaurant. There was about 8 of us which is probably the ideal number (8-10) comfortably sat around a round table. 
They started with the hand washing and distribution of towels (yeah we were dressed all nicely which is fine, but keep in mind that your pants might get dirty). The cucumber and eggplant portion (it tasted like beef lol) was delicious, the chicken/egg plate was odd but we liked the flaky stuff as we all choked on the powdered sugar on top haha Then came the meats; we had the mild chicken with olives where, its true, the meat just fell right off the bones, and we had half of the beef kebabs and half of the lamb. The lamb was dry, definitely go with the beef kebabs. The couscous was ok, not really great but it probably would have been better to give that before the meat courses because we were getting stuffed. The desserts were fabulous; incredibly fresh fruit,  yummy baklava, and tasty mint tea. The courses were nicely paced and we were finished dinner in a little over 2 hours. All of this for $25 a person! And if you get the wine carafe ($12), get the white wine. 
Now for those of you interested in the belly dancer, our dancer was not that great. She seemed nice but we weren't really into it. However, the other incredibly drunk parties were (luckily we only had to deal with them for a few courses).
So gather round some friends, pick a date, and fumble through your way to Marrakesh into the alley and the very dimly lit rooms. You'll like what you find.","Text1: Pros: 
-When we arrived at 10am there was still a wait but it was only a few minutes.
-Cash only but the ATM fee is only $1.75. 
-Our waiter took care of us pretty well, even though he seemed quite busy. That's OK, he still brought out everything we asked for and much faster than we expected. 
-The house coffee, orange juice (fresh squeezed!), and sweet potato fries are fantastic. We brought some champagne with us and enjoyed our newly converted mimosas.

Cons: 
-This place is really small. A gentleman had to get up so I could get to my seat. If I didn't scoot all the way in, the person behind me wouldn't be able to sit, and I am not a big person.

1,"Naked is a cyber-cafe, one of the first ones to make a go of it in E-town. Maybe that's because it's open 24 hours a day.

When I need a break from working at home but don't want to worry about closing time, this is a good option. It's pretty subdued, and most people here have their nose stuck in terminals with earphones on. There's chess table at the back, so sometimes people play, but mostly it's calm and relaxing. The walls are dark, and the lights are dim; no fluorescents here. They sell coffee and a few food items, but mostly make their money on computer and Internet rentals. This place is cash only, so come with real dough. No virtual stuff accepted here - ironically.","I was so excited when I saw that a new Famoso was going in at Christy's Corner in north Edmonton. This place, which serves authentic Neapolitan pizza, has been a real hit in the downtown location, but I must say this new location has an even better ambiance, although there's nothing wrong with the Jasper one, it's just got more of a casual lunch-time vibe. 

This space has high ceilings, a tall wine rack display in the front, rustic, elegant dining-room lighting and a lively open kitchen design concept, so you can watch your thin-crusted pizza being flipped and spun then fed into a massive oven and fire-roasted to perfection. 

Every time I have dropped in to this location people have been squeezed to the door. Since it's close to the movie theatre and they offer a pizza-and-movie deal for $16 from Mondays to Thursdays, people flock here before the show. I almost always get the Margherita pizza, which might seem plain to lovers of stacked pizzas, but ""when in Italy""...eat thin-crusted pizza with the freshest of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese - with minimal toppings - just as the Italians do. 

However, I add roasted mushrooms because I just think mushrooms belong on everything!

I have been eyeing the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls on the menu for quite some time, but have yet to order them. As I write this, I have broken tradition, and am feasting on Famoso's prosciutto and arugula sandwich. It is fantastic. The combination of fresh basil leaves, giant slices of fresh mozza, vine-ripened tomatoes and thin slices of savoury prosciutto is absolutely de-lish! My only complaint is I'd like a little more prosciutto to balance out the other flavors.

The sandwich portion is huge (it could easily feed two for $12.50!) and I think I will eat half and order the tiramisu for dessert, because this tiramisu isn't just made from an authentic Italian recipe, it is imported from Milan, Italy. 

(30 minutes later) I am savouring the tiramisu with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle and an Americano. Gusta Delizioso!

0,"Ok, aYUP it is ok.

We have been a few times now.

Friendly folks, but know nothing of service. No matter what we have ever had to drink a refill was never offered.... well not quite true, we were offered a refill as we were paying the bill today. I had coffee and water, the coffee should be advertised as the slowest drip coffee in the west, and apparently only one cup was brewed. Water too must be in short supply. Also iced tea ordered by the others ran dry and they do not bring a large glass full to begin with. 

The food is good, thus being ok. Last time we got tacos there was a salad on the plate, today nothing but the tacos. They had a nice flavour but not quite as robust as before.  The other food was fine in its flavour. 

We sat outside today, man what a depressing setting. That place needs some imagination and care to make it a pleasant experience. The inside of the building is small but pleasant enough. 

I hope this place does well but it truly needs to step up its game in service and consistency of food. 

So yeah it is ok as it sits, but my home kitchen is ok too.

Looking at the pictures I see what we ordered and see it is not what we got.","Jackson's seems to be a college kid favorite. I've been there many a time and I have to say I do like their drinks, but the price is a bit much. They have a pomegranate margarita that has gotten me into trouble more than once though. The drink menu is very diverse that everyone can find something they like. 

As for the food, I've never been a huge fan. Their chopped salad isn't very impressive and their torrados (kind of like a wrap that's been grilled like a panini) always give me the impression they'd taste better without the grilling. All their ingredients seem to be high quality, I guess I just dislike their cooking styles. As a Cajun fan I was also very disappointed by their Gumbo, they say it has okra in it but I didn't notice and there wasn't any rice that came with it. My friends love their fried Twinkie dessert but I wasn't impressed. The Cookie-Dough Egg Rolls are fantastic though. 

Overall, I love Jackson's. I love the ambiance, atmosphere and drink specials. I don't like going their for dinner, but dessert and drinks is always good.","Text1: Ok, aYUP it is ok.

1,"My experience at Sbraga last night made me very happy.  I would like to see this restaurant succeed and thrive and I believe it has the potential.

As I entered the restaurant I could tell that the renovations and new layout worked very nicely.  The bar is off to the left and it seems that they have their ""quick-fire"" kitchen out in the open so you can see the kitchen staff hard at work.  Nice touch.

We all went for the tasting menu and it is a value.  For my first course, I went with the truffled chicken caesar salad.  While this may seem like a very safe bet I can assure you that the homemade dressing had the zing of anchovies and they spared no expense on the insane amount of truffle on the chicken.  I did get a taste of the sweetbreads which where quite crispy and delicious.

Second course, fish and chips.  Oh my God.  These were just ridiculously good.  The fish was fried perfectly (aka, light, not oily) and the few chips were cooked nicely as well.  What made this dish stand out was the use of curry in both the batter and sauce and thinly sliced jalapeno.  It just made it delectable.  Really, you've gotta try them.

Third was the lamb belly with an avocado puree.  It was delicious and I expected it to be that way.  The plate was highly artistic and very rich in flavor.  The portion size was also substantial.

Finally, a cheese plate for dessert.  There was an american camembert and another cheese which I don't recall.  It was awesome.  Great portion size and with a Central Waters Pale Ale, my palette and my stomach were happy.

Food, decor, service, this place really shines.  I can't wait to return.  It's the perfect pre-theater meal.","I'm a big fan of 30th street.  Let me count the ways:

It's easily accessible, by car or train.  Cabbies actually know how to get there (huge win)

It's very nicely sized.  People aren't standing all over you like some other major stations.

Variety of food options: You can come early and grab your pre train meal.  Even a halfway decent bar for beers.

Food trucks: The porch is where it's at.

It's clean.  The bathrooms are bathrooms and are probably the least cleanly, but still, it's not bad.

0,"I'm between a 2 and 3 star rating for Old Standard. It's not a place I'd visit again unless someone else was really pushing for it.

What was good:

Fried pickles! Why no one has thought to batter and fry bread-and-butter pickles before is beyond me, but this place does it and they were pretty darn good.

Fun sodas! House-made flavors like double cream, pumpkin spice, and some other options. 

Unfortunately, this place is not named ""Old Standard Fried Pickles and Fun Sodas"", or it'd be a 4-star establishment. It's named for fried chicken. And the fried chicken was not good. 

I have no problem paying the $11 or whatever for 2 pieces of chicken, a side and a biscuit if it's extra special and super delicious. I liked that you can pick any two pieces you want. That's a nice touch. The mac n' cheese was A-OK, as was the biscuit. But I can't get over how bad the chicken was. 

The pieces were over-fried and super dried out. I got the leg and breast, and gave up after one bite of the breast. The breading cracked and fell off in hard, super crunchy pieces. Nothing tasted seasoned or marinated. No one could ever call this chicken juicy or  even greasy, which would have been better than what was served. It was so, so overdone. I don't know how it made it out of the kitchen like that. If you're a chicken place, you've got to be good at chicken.

In this brave new world of paying $15 for things like fried chicken and ramen, I've upped my standards. Unfortunately, Old Standard fell below mine.","What can I say?  I just love Target.  This is the closest one to our house, so we venture here quite often.  Usually at least twice a week.  Now that they have an expanded grocery section, we go even more.  They have all the staple items we need and more.  They also have all the household cleaners/items, hygiene products, and over-the-counter medications that we use, at great prices.  There are some departments where their selection isn't the best, like certain bathroom and kitchen items, but overall, they can often be our ""one stop shop"".

This particular Target is always clean.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  The store is laid out in a way that is easy enough for me to navigate.  My only gripe is that they sometimes don't have enough registers opened, but when the lines are getting out of hand, they are generally quick to remedy that.

In summary:  I love Target, even though they take more money from me than I ever plan on spending because I always find more items I need!

1,"I'm certainly not a vegetarian, but I wouldn't say that I adore eating meat all the time, either. But! The promise of a good BBQ place is definitely enticing. 

We went on a weekday around 5:30pm, so the restaurant was not busy when we got there. However, it did fill up steadily after that. I liked the decor. Western flavour but subtle and well done. 

I was tempted to order an appetizer but decided against it because I knew the mains would be too big. I was also tempted to just go with a pulled pork sandwich, but we decided to go all out and share two big mains to really get a taste of what they were all about. We ordered a half rack of ribs ($16 I believe) and the Road Kill ($18). I have never seen a bigger freakin' sandwich in my life. I thought the ribs were good but I wasn't blown away by them. I think I had really built up the anticipation due to reading all of the wonderful reviews. I didn't even know how to tackle the Road Kill, so I sort of just stabbed and sliced and picked parts off of it. I think it would have been a better experience if I could have bitten through the whole thing and had all of the flavours at the same time. The waffle bread was a nice touch. 

The service was fine. Our waitress indicated to us that she was new, but she did a good job. Sure, the food took a bit longer to come out than other places, but I think that's to be expected at a BBQ restaurant.

I don't think I would ever become a regular here just due to the sheer amount of meat. I only managed to eat two ribs and about 25% of the Road Kill. I would like to go back to try something smaller, perhaps the pulled pork or beef brisket sandwich, or maybe a couple of the appetizers as a meal in themselves.","My brother-in-law and his soon to be wife took us out for dinner here mid-week. We met at 7pm on a Tuesday and had to wait a few minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant wasn't full. Not a big deal. The table we got was strange, though. It was a big round table in the middle of all the booths, and really close to the kitchen, so I could hear all the kitchen noise and see some of the action.

Our sever, Curt (I think), was really great. He was friendly, attentive, checked on us enough but not too much, joked around with my father-in-law. He was a fairly young guy, working in a Boston Pizza in the middle of the week, so I have to admit I was really surprised at how good he was. It was actually some of the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time.

All of our food was as ordered and come out in a timely manner. No problems there. It was Tuesday night and all wine was half off!

The only gross thing was that there was garbage and dirt all over the floor, under our table and everywhere. Napkins, crumbs, food remnants.

0,"In my recent Panera review, I say, ""Oh, and if I want something that's a thousand times better than a bear claw, I will go to Swiss Haus Bakery in Center City where they have a delicious almond croissant filled with a huge helping of wonderful almond cream.""

Swiss Haus is my go-to place for a wonderful sweet treat. I absolutely love their pecan diamonds (basically pecan pie bars), raspberry walnut croissants, almond cream croissants, apricot/raspberry twists, and their cookies. They tend to be a little pricey, but it's quality comfort dessert food, so it's worth it. The ladies working behind the counter, owner Jim, and head chef Donna are always nice.

I recently tried their vanilla cronut. I had always been hesitant on getting it because it's $5 and for $4 I could get one of their other wonderful desserts, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I had had one other cronut from the now defunct Crumbs bake shop in Rittenhouse Square. I can see why that shop closed. Their cronut was hard and terrible. I don't like kicking something when it's down, but it was such a crappy cronut and I discovered that the place was closed a week later that I didn't bother writing a scathing review for it. To think that Crumbs started in my hometown, too! Blasphemy. Anyways, Swiss Haus' cronut was the complete opposite. The layers were flaky and soft and the outer part crisped perfection. I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers. The entire $5 experience of a Swiss Haus cronut was basically lunch for me. It's a very filling pastry! Try it, try it, try it. You must. Maybe a suggestion for future cronuts... a raspberry filling... mmmm!!!!","This Acme is one of the smaller and less crowded grocery stores in the area. I have never had an issue with customer service. In fact, I can't say enough nice things about the butcher at ACME. He was kind enough to help my mom and I select the appropriate size meat for a party and even cracked the ribs and trimmed some fat for us.  

Selection and inventory here is typical to any grocery store. One of their unique features is their BOGO cooler in the back of the store.

ACME also has $5 hoagies, granted they aren't as fabulous as a Wawa hoagie, but they're good and can easily be split between two people.","Text1: In my recent Panera review, I say, ""Oh, and if I want something that's a thousand times better than a bear claw, I will go to Swiss Haus Bakery in Center City where they have a delicious almond croissant filled with a huge helping of wonderful almond cream.""

Swiss Haus is my go-to place for a wonderful sweet treat. I absolutely love their pecan diamonds (basically pecan pie bars), raspberry walnut croissants, almond cream croissants, apricot/raspberry twists, and their cookies. They tend to be a little pricey, but it's quality comfort dessert food, so it's worth it. The ladies working behind the counter, owner Jim, and head chef Donna are always nice.

I recently tried their vanilla cronut. I had always been hesitant on getting it because it's $5 and for $4 I could get one of their other wonderful desserts, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. I had had one other cronut from the now defunct Crumbs bake shop in Rittenhouse Square. I can see why that shop closed. Their cronut was hard and terrible. I don't like kicking something when it's down, but it was such a crappy cronut and I discovered that the place was closed a week later that I didn't bother writing a scathing review for it. To think that Crumbs started in my hometown, too! Blasphemy. Anyways, Swiss Haus' cronut was the complete opposite. The layers were flaky and soft and the outer part crisped perfection. I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers. The entire $5 experience of a Swiss Haus cronut was basically lunch for me. It's a very filling pastry! Try it, try it, try it. You must. Maybe a suggestion for future cronuts... a raspberry filling... mmmm!!!! 

 Text2: This Acme is one of the smaller and less crowded grocery stores in the area. I have never had an issue with customer service. In fact, I can't say enough nice things about the butcher at ACME. He was kind enough to help my mom and I select the appropriate size meat for a party and even cracked the ribs and trimmed some fat for us.  

Selection and inventory here is typical to any grocery store. One of their unique features is their BOGO cooler in the back of the store.

0,"I've heard good things about The Burger Joint for awhile but don't make the trek out for burgers very often. Well, well, things finally worked out and we came to check out the BJ on a Saturday afternoon. Great nickname eh?

It's located in the same plaza as Loma House. The menu is simple; 10 signature burgers to choose from (2 are vegetarian) or else it's BYOB.  

- Curly fries ($3.75) - fries were piping hot, crunchy, crispy and come with two side dips (homemade ketchup and tartar sauce).

- Sunrise chicken ($8.99) - this one tasted like summer; sweet, light and refreshing.

- Spicy crunch ($8.99) - this burger was completely different and was a nice change of pace. We both preferred the spicy crunch; it was meatier and more satisfying.

Pretty solid place to grab some gourmet style burgers. I'd hit this place up again if I were planning to stuff my face a la Guy Fieri style. 3.5 stars.","Best wings in Tucson by far!! My husband and I go there maybe once a week, he goes for spicy and I get ""honey hot"" (spicy BBQ). The wings are nice and meaty with just the right amount of sauce, and when you buy by the dozen, the prices are very reasonable.","Text1: I've heard good things about The Burger Joint for awhile but don't make the trek out for burgers very often.

1,"Stopped in here for lunch and walked out uncomfortable with a full belly! Was only going to get a grilled cheese sandwich, but my check-in via Yelp gave me a free soup so I went ahead and cashed in on it right there and then. Got the Smokey Corn Chowder with Bacon, and while it was quite delicious, it was heavy and I probably could have made that my meal by itself. But no, I continued on and ate all of my Baja Melt sandwich and washed it all down with a New Hope Root Beer. I really wanted one of their shakes, but I'm pretty sure I would have puked as I was utterly stuffed. I can only imagine how many calories and fat I took in during that hour, which leads me to one gripe--they don't publish their nutritional data on their web site. Personally, I get really frustrated when restaurants don't do this. There is a little kids seating area with a TV to keep them occupied. I'm surprised that they don't have a Mac-n-Cheese item on their menu.

Everything here is ordered al a carte and I went with a chicken enchilada covered in a lemon cream sauce and a fish taco, which is filled with lightly fried tilapia. We also got an order of chips and guacamole for the table. The guacamole was good and I enjoyed my fish taco, even though it had a bit of a kick to it. The enchilada was good and I really liked the lemon cream sauce, but it was pretty greasy, which is why I think it just sat on my the rest of the day. As for drinks, I went with sweet tea, which there were free refills on, but if you got soda, it looked like you just got a can, which would mean no free refills. All in all, not a bad place and I would stop in again the next time I'm in the area.","Text1: Stopped in here for lunch and walked out uncomfortable with a full belly!

0,"I knew as I stepped foot on the Village Pub's front porch, I was going to love it there. I felt right at home. 

We grabbed some stools at the bar and posted up to watch the 2011 Women's World Cup final game. As disappointing as the game was, the bar was the complete opposite. 

The bartender was extremely friendly and greeted us as soon as we sat down. He was even nice enough to let us know that it was 1/2 off all draught beers until 2 every Sunday. So for a little less than $3.50 you can get a 24oz glass of Sweetwater, or whatever it is you prefer. 

The food at this place is really great too. We ordered the pretzels with the beer cheese dipping sauce. That beer cheese sauce is so mint. We also, ordered the a veggie sandwich that was great too. 

I will for sure make the trek back to east Nashville for some more cheap beers and beer cheese.","We enjoyed our meal. The prices are reasonable, they're pet friendly and even bought the baby a cold bowl of water. The ribs were tender and flavorful, as well as the beans and jalapeño corn bread.

Great beer selection and a full bar menu with friendly wait staff. The food we tried on our visit was OK. We had the spinach artichoke dip, nachos, and loaded waffle fries. Nothing to write home about, but they did the job at 12:30am. 

Advisory: Cops are ALWAYS out on Charlotte anyway, and now they are even more vigilant with this new bar.

Came in with a decent sized group after attending wine on the river, so I must admit that parts of this meal are slightly hazy. However, after doing a bit of detective work, I have pieced together my experience. 

What I remember: 
-Ordering a turkey burger and the famous potatoes on the side
-Having one well liquor drink
-The potatoes being extremely soggy and floppy

Fast forward to two days later. This is me checking my credit card statement:

""Holy $*&^ I spent $50 at National Underground?? How did that happen?""

Then the pieces started falling into place. 
-I picked up the tab for my BF (still. TWO burgers and two drinks- a beer and well vodka should not be $50)
-We had to buy BOTTLED water. That cost $2 extra per bottle. 
-There was an up charge for the potatoes that were floppy and not good

Yikes. That's a lot for a drunken meal that I half remember. I had a good experience the first time when I was a bit more coherent, so I'm definitely going to try and be a lot more careful when eating here. If it's late night, I'm choosing Broadway Brewhouse, and next year I think Mexican food is more appropriate for post wine on the river food.","Text1: I'm so excited they opened a Melrose on the West Side!

1,"I would definitely have to agree with Byron J. on this one (we seem to frequent many of the same locations)...

I live about 2 miles from Five Guys and I rarely crave red meat, but when I do, I make an effort to have a burger...when Five Guys got to town, my hubby and I were very excited to give it a go.

We've tried it on SEVERAL occasions.  First of all, I know they make everything to order, but they are SLOW.  This is kind of annoying when I just want to grab and go...SECOND, it is underwhelmingly decent but not a fantastic burger.  

When a place SPECIALIZES in one thing, I think it should be done PERFECT, every time, no exception.  The one thing I do like about the burgers is the bacon.  They do the bacon AWESOME.  Everything else is just average, which is fairly disappointing considering it's ALL they do.

I also think it's ironic that they BOAST about how fabulous they are on every wall. Too bad none of those are local.  Maybe I'll check out a Five Guys in another city, but I would recommend Hardees over this joint and they are a LOT faster!","As soon as I heard about this, I had to go!  My gal pal Stacy got a group of random friends together (couples date day downtown) and we all paid her our $25/pp in advance for the 2 hour tour around the city.  Rain or shine it said and it rained ....and we still had a blast.  I didn't pedal (too short and too lazy) but it was a lot of fun to ride (on the back and the side).  We brought our own beers and blasted an Ipod full of ridiculous tunes as we pedaled through the city on a busy Saturday afternoon.  For all of those cars who got stuck behind us, we're sorry but come on!  It was fun to watch us ride, right?

It's a bar on wheels....but there are rules.  Alcohol cannot leave the bike, no serving beers to pedestrians (aka - not a ""real"" bar that way) and stay on time or there's a late fee.  We managed to follow the rules, have a great time and no one threw up from drinking and riding.  That's a score in my book.

We made two ""pit"" stops - one on Mass and one on Meridian to urinate and take a shot.  Then we continued on the ride, switching seats and making new friends along the way.

This is great for groups of any kind - you do not have to drink but it does make it a little more fun with a buzz.  This bike is ridiculous and awesome at the same time.  You don't have to be super active or in great shape (after all, there are 10 riders) but if you don't want to be outside they say to stay at home.  And there are no rainchecks for bad weather (even snow) so don't get whiny if the sun isn't out.  We rode in partial downpour and it was even more fun than I thought it would be!  

I am considering this as an option for a birthday party outing, girls' night out, the list goes on for who would enjoy this little bit of rowdy fun!  Everyone seemed to really get a kick of out it and for those of us who have lived in Indy a long time, it's nice to see something new and different enter the area with a bit of creative energy that can be enjoyed while consuming alcohol or not.","Text1: I would definitely have to agree with Byron J. on this one (we seem to frequent many of the same locations)...

1,"Hubby and I love living in Franklin, and while we don't live in Westhaven, we frequent this neighborhood for the great little Chinese place next door.  This past weekend we noticed a new neighbor to our stir fry haunt, and had to pop in. 

It seems they only opened two weeks ago, and Hi Brow is a coffee place, a pastry place, and an ice cream place as well.  It's a small little shop, but the coffee aroma triples its square footage if the front doors are propped open like they were on the night we visited.

We enter the front door and see this HUGE farmhouse type table with this amazing chandelier and glass domed cake stands, wire baskets of pastries, and random other goodies with comfy benches to prop up a seat.  On one side there's a cooler with chilled beverages, and at the back there is a small ice cream freezer sporting about eight flavors and a helpful, smiling barista.

We had just eaten and of course were not hungry at all, which means I got ice cream.  I picked a buttery caramel traditional cream based something or another flavor, and it was yummy.  It was rich, way rich, I could tell I've been on pinkberry for a while now... a nice little treat.

A plus for some would be that they serve you ice cream in a cup with a wooden spoon, felt like a balsa wood or something.  I'm all for saving the planet, and I get that plastic is practically forever, but I gotta say the sensation of that wooden spoon in your mouth with ice cream... not a fan.  It was just weird.

Will we stop back in another day?  I'm sure we will.  And I'll opt for a cone, and probably pick a less rich flavor for my palate, but cute nonetheless.

The barista/ice cream scooper lady said the name Hi Brow comes from the name of the farm the owners also own.  And if you're thinking that huge neon sign is just an HB and not Hi Brow, you'd be right.  Signage isn't big here, but in a community like Westhaven, that's OK.

Have visited twice, and those visits were months apart.

Trip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.

Trip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.

Hubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.

0,"Its peaceful.  Basically endless fields with trees that you can view through a drive through.  There's not much to say as this is just a road, but its a pretty cool view.","You had me at ""bacon sampler.""

I can't believe I never noticed this place before.  Probably because it's nestled in the corner of a busy strip mall with the looming shadow of PJ Whelans across the street.  Harry's blows PJs out of the water though.

We went for a work lunch, so I couldn't try any of the beer, but I must say that the tap list was very impressive.  

For food we all tried the burgers with different toppings.  My friend went with the donut burger which he liked and I went with the cheese, bacon, and peanut butter burger.  It was out of this world other than being a little overcooked for my liking.  

The best part was the bacon sampler.  Market price.  4 types of bacon to try.  It was enough for the 4 of us at the table to try a bit of each.  All different and delicious.

This is a strip mall so there is a fair amount of parking, but don't even dare parking over here and trying to walk across the street to PJs.  They are serious about that!","Text1: Its peaceful.  Basically endless fields with trees that you can view through a drive through.  There's not much to say as this is just a road, but its a pretty cool view. 

 Text2: You had me at ""bacon sampler.""

I can't believe I never noticed this place before.  Probably because it's nestled in the corner of a busy strip mall with the looming shadow of PJ Whelans across the street.  Harry's blows PJs out of the water though.

We went for a work lunch, so I couldn't try any of the beer, but I must say that the tap list was very impressive.

Ceasar salad was ok, and the onion roll they serve for their bread basket was yummy, but not worth it. At all.","Solid place, tucked away on main street.  They have southwestern style food which is pretty solid and a good beer selection.  Definitely need to take advantage of their specials, my favorite is Margarita Mondays which offers $10 pitchers and comes with free chips and salsa.  When the weather's nice there's outdoor seating.  Defintiely worth checking out.","Text1: Not terrible, but so ridiculously expensive. Unless you stuck to appetizers and soup, your meal was going well north of 30 dollars.

1,"After years of driving by, we decided to stop in for dinner.  From the street, it looks like a dive bar but it isn't.  The interior is expansive and as neat as a pin.  We were there on a Wednesday which apparently was Trivia Night and it was packed by 6:30.  You can sit anywhere that doesn't have a 'Reserved' sign on it so we found ourselves a nice booth.

Going by Jerry G.'s awesome review from awhile back, we had to order the Fish & Chips.  Also, because we can't get enough fried food in our diets, we ordered a side of Onion Rings. (see pics)  The Fish & Chips were piping hot, crispy and delicious!  It was a huge portion.  The Onion Rings were great, too.  They came with a horseradish sauce for dipping. 

Despite the large crowd, the service was fast and friendly.  Their menu is vast and we are going to try to work our way through it.  We had a great meal.  I would definitely recommend Finley's for a drink or dinner.","We are always anxious to try new places here in Clearwater and we had received a flier in the mail with coupons so we were off!  It is located in the spot that once housed a UPS store next to Costco on US19.  The decor and furnishings were rather upscale for a strip center and everything was clean and new.

We got there around 6-ish and landed a cozy booth. Our waitress explained how the system worked.  Ordering food as you finish your prior course and the penalties for unfinished food.  As a rule, we do not leave food on our plates, anyway.  And so, the ordering began.  We quickly developed a plan of attack.  We wanted to try a little bit of everything and, unfortunately we did not succeed because it was just too much.

We started with a salad with ginger dressing, their hot and sour soup, Spring rolls and the gyoza(pan-fried dumplings).  The salad and soup came out first...they bring the food right out as it's prepared.  Next, we ordered the salt and pepper calamari and OMG!  Moving on, we had the General Tso's chicken and the teriyaki shrimp.  These dishes were modest sized portions so we felt at ease to dive right into the sushi options. 

Due to their grand opening promotion and huge success, we had to wait a bit for our 3 sushi rolls. I am not a connoisseur of all things sushi but I liked the rolls that we ordered(Tampa, Volcano and Saki rolls). And finally, we ordered the fried banana for dessert which you have to try.

Overall, it was a fair price for freshly made food.  The staff was very friendly and the owner had come by our booth several times to apologize for our tardy sushi. We will definitely be back because we never tried any of their hibachi offerings and that it was a very pleasant dinner.  We never felt rushed, either.","Text1: After years of driving by, we decided to stop in for dinner.  From the street, it looks like a dive bar but it isn't.

0,Great bar on the divey side.  Drinks are cheap and atmosphere is chill for happy hour.,"What I expect when I go get Pho:

1) huge portions
2) fast service
3) lotsa noodles but also a good balance of other soup ingredients
4) ridiculous amount of choices
5) cheap

Pho Hoa hits all these points. It took us a little long to actually get a waiter to come to us-- I think they were confused because our party staggered in at stages so I don't think they knew when everybody was there so giving them the benefit of the doubt. But they have an extensive menu and they let me order what I always like to order in my Pho-- shrimp and tofu and veggies. And it was delish. We were confused if this was a BYOB since they had drinks on their menu. So I don't think it is.

I paid $10 for Pho and an appetizer. That's including tip. Life is good.

Oh and there were huge flat screen TVs so we could eat silently and watch the game. Exactly how I like to spend time with my guy friends.","Text1: Great bar on the divey side.  Drinks are cheap and atmosphere is chill for happy hour.

0,"Stopped in here for lunch with some coworkers and while I enjoyed my meal, it sat with me for the rest of the day! Everything here is ordered al a carte and I went with a chicken enchilada covered in a lemon cream sauce and a fish taco, which is filled with lightly fried tilapia. We also got an order of chips and guacamole for the table. The guacamole was good and I enjoyed my fish taco, even though it had a bit of a kick to it. The enchilada was good and I really liked the lemon cream sauce, but it was pretty greasy, which is why I think it just sat on my the rest of the day. As for drinks, I went with sweet tea, which there were free refills on, but if you got soda, it looked like you just got a can, which would mean no free refills. All in all, not a bad place and I would stop in again the next time I'm in the area.","Holy crap. I walk past this place a few times a week and we finally stopped in. Incredible.

The prices are pretty standard, definitely comparable to chain build-your-own. 3.95-6.95, I'm guessing. I got one right in the middle at 5.25, which was pretty average. BUT THE QUALITY IS NO CHEAPO STUFF.

First, the tortilla is made on site, and you can tell. The only time I've had a quality shell like that was LITERALLY IN MEXICO. I got the whole grain and it was incredible, with a little bit of singe taste on it. Also I got the guacamole with sour cream in it, which they charge extra for, but if you wanted salsa or guac or something on the side, DON'T PAY FOR IT. It says it costs extra, and they'll charge you if you say you want it on the side, but there's a complimentary salsa bar that has these things available. Just thought you should know.

The service wasn't impressive, but we didn't wait long for our food, and it was amazing food. AMAZING food. We were so glad to try out this gem at long last. Will be going back again and again.","Text1: Stopped in here for lunch with some coworkers and while I enjoyed my meal, it sat with me for the rest of the day!

I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!","Situated right in the heart of the city, this place has good vegetarian options. I went there for lunch and it was super busy. I had a bistro Bella burger and my friend has a veggie burger. Both the burgers tasted good and I weren't too greasy. The place is really small. There are not enough tables to dine in. It is more of a take out place. The orders come by in about 5 minutes which is not bad at all. 

Notable: the way they take orders at a super busy hour of the day was pretty cool and hi-tech with two people working hand in hand is a perfect assembly line. One person with a tablet, takes the order while you are in the queue and the girl behind the counter takes the pay. 

Two cents: the place could be a little bigger with more seating area.","Text1: My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!!

1,"This place is literally magical.  

Here's the story.  We bought a car with what we thought was road paint or concrete stuck to the bottom half of the car right near the front wheel.  Oh well.  We had gotten it washed at numerous places including expensive places like the one on Spring Garden and 11th.

Fast forward to our trip to Magic Car Wash.  They have a strange system where you get out of the car while it goes through the car wash only to come out driven by a gentleman.  At this point, I notice that there was still a stain on the door right above the paint/concrete.  This is what I thought the worker was going to attend to when he approached the car with a spray bottle of magical fluid.  Instead, he started working on the paint/concrete in what I thought was in vain.  NOPE.  He actually cleaned the paint/concrete off in a move that caused both my fianceé and my jaw to drop.  

They seriously went above and beyond any normal car wash place.  I will take my car here as long as I live in this area, for sure.","To be fair, I haven't gone to a major league baseball game since I was in kindergarden.  Still, I had a great time for the price paid!  I really felt as though I was taken care of here and the food, although super expensive, was alright.

0,"I went in to try on and order a bridesmaid dress a few months ago, and was told to come back a month before when I need it for alterations. I have 6 weeks before my friend's wedding in another state, so I figured I would go in and have it taken care of. All was fine until I went in to get it adjusted.

I made an appointment a few days prior, and when I arrived, I got a ""Well, you're not listed on here, but that's okay, we have time."" Way to make me sound like an inconvenience; I could tell this was going to be an awesome experience.  After lecturing me on making sure I had shoes on because they ""drastically change your posture"" I told the woman I would be taking care of the hemming myself once I decided on a 2.5 inch heel or a 3 inch heel and it wouldn't be enough of a difference to affect the bodice section. After getting into the dress and walking out, I made a comment about having to buy 2 sizes bigger for it to fit my butt (bottom heavy), so I needed to have a bit over 3 inches taken out of the top. One of the employees decided to make a fantastic remark - ""You either have to pay to have the dress altered or pay to have surgery."" Excuse me? When is that ever appropriate? I kind of like my ass, and I can't really do a whole lot about it. The Puerto Rican side of my genes leaves me with more butt than I know what to do with. But back to my complaint.

I decided to go through with having it pinned and getting the tally to have the proper bust alterations. $195. Pre-tax. Not including hemming (which would have been a minimum of $30 as per the chart in the dressing room). That also included a ""rush fee"" because I didn't want to wait until the day I get on a plane to go to a wedding out of state (Who does that? What if there's a colossal f-up?). Apparently wanting it done in anything less than 5 weeks is considered a rush job, even though the sales associate said I should come back a month before I needed it (remember, I gave myself 6 weeks just to be safe). I paid around $180 for the dress to begin with. I told her it was ridiculous and I wanted my dress back. Sorry. Paying $400 by the time it's all said and done for a bridesmaid dress made out of polyester? I'll pass. And I'll pass on piss-poor customer service too. Those women need a trip back to training and I would personally classify it as firing material if I was their boss.

So yeah, avoid alterations there like the plague. I took someone's recommendation to check out the Burlington Coat Factory's tailor/alterations woman (Bernadette) just a little bit up the road from this location. She was appalled at what I told her and wrote up the same alterations PLUS the hemming for a little over $100.

0,Nice little spot in a very unexpected little plaza. We started with the lamb tartare which was yummy with the little pieces of cut up beet.

1,"After much hype and anticipation, a visit to 500 Degrees didn't completely blow my mind but was undoubtedly delicious. It was hard to decide with this spot's huge number of patty/topping options. I ordered a medium Kobe burger (because the grass-fed Prime wasn't available) with boar bacon, long hots, and a side of truffle fries.

The patty was the star, though it was more of a medium rare. Still, it was deliciously beefy, melt-in-your-mouth juicy, and properly seasoned. The brioche bun did a good job of sopping up the juices but got messy after a while. Truffle fries were shatteringly crisp on the outside with creamy insides and the perfect amount of salt, excellent dipped in their fry sauce.

I did have a couple gripes. The boar bacon tasted great but resembled leather texturally, and the cook went a little overboard with the truffle oil on my fries. Still, this burger's quality surpassed the likes of similar joints, a truly gourmet burger in a fast food setting. Open until 3 on weekends to boot. Well worth a stop for a quick but delicious burger.","Desi Village has been in business for years, but after sampling it I think that speaks more to the lack of Indian options in KOP proper.

When I walk into an Indian (or any type of predominantly ethnic) restaurant and see mostly gringos, it makes me raise my eyebrows. I will say that nothing was particularly offensive about the food and I've had far worse North Indian fare in restaurants, hence the three star rating. However, my meal wasn't something that would keep me coming back. The spicing and seasoning of the various curries is surprisingly vibrant, but these sauces feel quite heavy. The meats here aren't the best, as my lamb was overcooked and a bit tough. The vegetables in the Jalfrezi were the frozen, supermarket variety, which was not enjoyable at all. Naans are average, rice is prepared well. Everything is overpriced.

The food earns 2 stars, but the service was friendly enough to warrant another. Desi Village's food is simply average, and fairly costly for the quality. I won't be returning any time soon unless I'm magically stranded in KOP with few other options.","Text1: After much hype and anticipation, a visit to 500 Degrees didn't completely blow my mind but was undoubtedly delicious.

0,"Look, I get it - this is ""Mexican"" fast food.  But it shouldn't be so fast to where the meat is Pittsburgh rare.

I ordered a steak taco salad and when I sat down to eat it, I could of sworn I heard cows moo-ing at me.  The steak was blood red.  Now, I'm not a picky eater, and I adore meat being a bit red (medium is perfect).  However, when bite-size pieces of steak are not cooked through, I quickly lose my appetite.  

I ended up chucking most of the salad in the trash for fear of getting sick from the uncooked meat.  I know, many people eat rare meat, but you know what? I don't. It's just a phobia I have.  So why is Qdoba cooking their steaks rare?

Perhaps it was just a lunch-rush fluke on that day.  I've had other things there that were decent, so perhaps I'll give them another go.  But I won't order the steak.",We love Sauce on the Side it's our go to restaurant in St. Louis for 'pizza' (they only serve calzones).

1,"So, about 20 min before 5 friends and I went to the restaurant to celebrate one of the ladies' birthday, I called.  When we walked in, they had our table for 6 ready for us.  

Double Shot Amaretto Sours for drink order and they were great!  We were off to a great start.

Appetizers : Zucchini Bites & Toasted Ravs (see pics).  Excellent in taste.  Really enjoyed the sauces they served with the zucchini.  Zucchini portion is enough for a table to share.  The Ravs were larger than your normal ravs and packed with flavorful meat.  There are only 4 Ravs, so order accordingly.

Entrees: (see pics) Seared Scallops, Cedar Salmon, Crab Cakes & Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  OMG, everything tasted exceptional!  We truly enjoyed the entrees.  What I loved is that each entree is available in a petit or large portion.  The flavors were spot on and well balanced.  The sides were very complimentary to the main focus of the plate.  I have to say the Sauteed Spinach and the Vanilla Sweet Potatos...oh wow...I could eat a plate of those for dinner several times over.

We didn't have room for dessert, however, the restaurant was kind enough to provide the BDay girl with a free dessert, which you don't find too often anymore.  They also brought the table 6 mini chocolate chip cookies that were complimentary.. they even tasted good.

Picking this restaurant was a last minute rush decision, but we are not disappointed that the evening took us here.  Will most definitely be back.  Kudos to the chef!!","Visited here with a group of Yelpers on a Tuesday evening.  Buy One Get One Free Pizza on Tuesdays, how awesome!  Our host ordered 4 types of pizza: Sausage/Pepp, Deluxe, Veggie and Meatball.  
I'm not a veggie type of chick, so I can't speak on that pizza, but the other 3 were really good.  So good that I ordered 2 pizzas to go for dinner throughout the week. The flavors of the meats were very good and their crust... I would consider it medium thickness, it's not Imo's thin, but it's not hand tossed... it's right in the middle.  

While this pizza isn't in my top 5, I did enjoy it and would have it again, especially on a Tuesday!","Text1: So, about 20 min before 5 friends and I went to the restaurant to celebrate one of the ladies' birthday, I called.  When we walked in, they had our table for 6 ready for us.

Brand new and totally redesigned from the traditional WF footprint, this is laid out to withstand any challenge from their mega competitors on all ends of the segment - low price chains like Wal Mart and high end chains like Wegmans. As a health market or organic store - it has no peer. 

Well lit, spacious, with windows all around to allow the sun to shine in, it gives off a relaxing vibe for healthy food shopping to take place.

The employees are extremely helpful and friendly. I couldn't find an item and two employees set me on the right direction. The check out worker we met had two huge safety pins from customer shout outs for her awesome service. 

The selection was excellent. A large number of Gardein items I can't find easily anywhere else. Plenty of Beyond burgers on hand. Fresh produce. Store made bread. 

We didn't get to it on this trip but we will the next time try a meal in the restaurant on the first floor. 

I realize this place takes a bad rap on higher prices but we found them comparable to the other markets in this category.

Parking in the front might get tight but there was more parking around the back.

If this is the future of WF, it's one I enthusiastically embrace and highly recommend.","3 1/2 starts is just right, but I'll bump it to 4 because I like the idea of a neighborhood Greek mezze joint, the place has a nice atmosphere, and the belly dancer knew how to shake it with a smile.

Things that I would not order again:

Falafel -- 3 pucks on a pita w/ hummus, a bunch of cucumber/onion/tomato, with feta and tzatziki on the side.  Looked real nice, unfortunately the falafel was pretty tasteless, as was the hummus.  But when you combine everything it's not so bad.

Bacon Phyllo -- bacon, mushrooms, and other stuff wrapped in phyllo dough, served over some marinara.   Kinda boring.

Beef Dolmades -- poorly wrapped, not much beef, ok flavor.

Things I would order again:

Mussels -- served in a flavorful tomato broth with a lot of veggies in it, pretty delicious.

Sea Bass w/ lemon Orzo -- YES!  my favorite item here.  The fish, orzo, and lemon cream sauce make an awesome combo.  Get this.

1,"I went in to try on and order a bridesmaid dress a few months ago, and was told to come back a month before when I need it for alterations. I have 6 weeks before my friend's wedding in another state, so I figured I would go in and have it taken care of. All was fine until I went in to get it adjusted.

I made an appointment a few days prior, and when I arrived, I got a ""Well, you're not listed on here, but that's okay, we have time."" Way to make me sound like an inconvenience; I could tell this was going to be an awesome experience.  After lecturing me on making sure I had shoes on because they ""drastically change your posture"" I told the woman I would be taking care of the hemming myself once I decided on a 2.5 inch heel or a 3 inch heel and it wouldn't be enough of a difference to affect the bodice section. After getting into the dress and walking out, I made a comment about having to buy 2 sizes bigger for it to fit my butt (bottom heavy), so I needed to have a bit over 3 inches taken out of the top. One of the employees decided to make a fantastic remark - ""You either have to pay to have the dress altered or pay to have surgery."" Excuse me? When is that ever appropriate? I kind of like my ass, and I can't really do a whole lot about it. The Puerto Rican side of my genes leaves me with more butt than I know what to do with. But back to my complaint.

I decided to go through with having it pinned and getting the tally to have the proper bust alterations. $195. Pre-tax. Not including hemming (which would have been a minimum of $30 as per the chart in the dressing room). That also included a ""rush fee"" because I didn't want to wait until the day I get on a plane to go to a wedding out of state (Who does that? What if there's a colossal f-up?). Apparently wanting it done in anything less than 5 weeks is considered a rush job, even though the sales associate said I should come back a month before I needed it (remember, I gave myself 6 weeks just to be safe). I paid around $180 for the dress to begin with. I told her it was ridiculous and I wanted my dress back. Sorry. Paying $400 by the time it's all said and done for a bridesmaid dress made out of polyester? I'll pass. And I'll pass on piss-poor customer service too. Those women need a trip back to training and I would personally classify it as firing material if I was their boss.

So yeah, avoid alterations there like the plague. I took someone's recommendation to check out the Burlington Coat Factory's tailor/alterations woman (Bernadette) just a little bit up the road from this location. She was appalled at what I told her and wrote up the same alterations PLUS the hemming for a little over $100. So yeah, it's obvious where my business went to.","I got to sample from a bunch of different places and I noticed two things, well, three things that were sort of strange/could be changed. It felt like there was an overwhelming number of sandwiches to try. While I like sandwiches they're very filling very fast. The second thing - it seemed like there was a lot of pork. Again, I love pork and all but I would have loved some exciting non-pork options. And last criticism - how am I supposed to try every truck if the portions are so big? I would have killed for half-size things at an event like this so everyone could have gotten my business. All in all it's a really nice event though and I wouldn't hesitate to go to another one.","Text1: I went in to try on and order a bridesmaid dress a few months ago, and was told to come back a month before when I need it for alterations. I have 6 weeks before my friend's wedding in another state, so I figured I would go in and have it taken care of. All was fine until I went in to get it adjusted.

I made an appointment a few days prior, and when I arrived, I got a ""Well, you're not listed on here, but that's okay, we have time."" Way to make me sound like an inconvenience; I could tell this was going to be an awesome experience.  After lecturing me on making sure I had shoes on because they ""drastically change your posture"" I told the woman I would be taking care of the hemming myself once I decided on a 2.5 inch heel or a 3 inch heel and it wouldn't be enough of a difference to affect the bodice section. After getting into the dress and walking out, I made a comment about having to buy 2 sizes bigger for it to fit my butt (bottom heavy), so I needed to have a bit over 3 inches taken out of the top. One of the employees decided to make a fantastic remark - ""You either have to pay to have the dress altered or pay to have surgery."" Excuse me? When is that ever appropriate? I kind of like my ass, and I can't really do a whole lot about it. The Puerto Rican side of my genes leaves me with more butt than I know what to do with. But back to my complaint.

I decided to go through with having it pinned and getting the tally to have the proper bust alterations. $195. Pre-tax. Not including hemming (which would have been a minimum of $30 as per the chart in the dressing room). That also included a ""rush fee"" because I didn't want to wait until the day I get on a plane to go to a wedding out of state (Who does that? What if there's a colossal f-up?). Apparently wanting it done in anything less than 5 weeks is considered a rush job, even though the sales associate said I should come back a month before I needed it (remember, I gave myself 6 weeks just to be safe). I paid around $180 for the dress to begin with. I told her it was ridiculous and I wanted my dress back. Sorry. Paying $400 by the time it's all said and done for a bridesmaid dress made out of polyester? I'll pass. And I'll pass on piss-poor customer service too. Those women need a trip back to training and I would personally classify it as firing material if I was their boss.

1,"Look, I get it - this is ""Mexican"" fast food.  But it shouldn't be so fast to where the meat is Pittsburgh rare.

I ordered a steak taco salad and when I sat down to eat it, I could of sworn I heard cows moo-ing at me.  The steak was blood red.  Now, I'm not a picky eater, and I adore meat being a bit red (medium is perfect).  However, when bite-size pieces of steak are not cooked through, I quickly lose my appetite.  

I ended up chucking most of the salad in the trash for fear of getting sick from the uncooked meat.  I know, many people eat rare meat, but you know what? I don't. It's just a phobia I have.  So why is Qdoba cooking their steaks rare?

Perhaps it was just a lunch-rush fluke on that day.  I've had other things there that were decent, so perhaps I'll give them another go.  But I won't order the steak.","We decided to give Kermit's a try, despite some of the negative reviews on here, as I find it difficult to trust people who don't know the difference between there/their/they're and to/too/two. 

We ordered the white mushroom pizza which I really enjoyed, even though I'm usually not a fan of white pizza.  The red pie we ordered consisted of garlic sausage and caramelized onions.  It was decent, but the white pizza won my heart.

It's difficult to find good pizza in Philly and Kermit's Bake Shop is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  If they delivered, they would be extra cool.","Text1: Look, I get it - this is ""Mexican"" fast food.  But it shouldn't be so fast to where the meat is Pittsburgh rare.

1,"The best part about Music City Central is the Dunkin Donuts.  I actually miss riding the bus because of my morning stopover in their store.  They really had it down to a science.  As for the bus terminal it's nice, they tend to be on time in the morning and overall they are getting better.  At night it gets a little sketchy but they do police it quite well.

I need the 56 Limited to skip Music City Central and keep going straight down West End, or Hillsboro.  Sigh, a girl can dream.","Gosh, I'm going against the grain here but I was not impressed. My food was bland, the spring rolls were fishy, the soda chanh was intensely sugared and I left feeling, ""eh."" We went last Friday and I ate pesce while there. I went with the tofu lemongrass and I seriously wish there was more sauce. It barely covered my tofu which left me eating unsauced noodles. I tried adding a ton of add-ons to try and get some flavor out of the sauce but no dice. The peanut sauce for the shrimp rolls was super watery and again the shrimp tasted old. The soda chanh was crazy sweet. I still enjoyed it but between that and the food I wavered between over-sugared and over-salted. My manpanion had the pho and he gave it an ""eh"" as well. I will say the prices were pretty awesome but I'm not sure we'll be back. There are other Vietnamese restaurants that I would rather frequent, e.g. Far East. FYI - they are now run by the owners of Miss Saigon and I had that very same dish there.

1,"I have been coming to Allisonville Nursery for many years now and continue to be impressed.  I have never purchased trees here but have purchased a wide variety of shrubs (boxwoods, hostas, ninebark, several viburnum varieties, etc.) and all are going very strong in my yard.

I've always been impressed with the quality of the plants here...although my father used to own a landscape business (and purchase wholesale) and I have a pretty good feel for prices.  I think some of it is a tad expensive.  Not too concerned though...I don't mind supporting local business and the store is just really cool.  None of the green peppers I purchased from here last year bore any fruit (similar plant from Home Depot same spot did fine), so that has been my only issue.

As others mentioned, there are a large selection of garden accents, pots, fertilizers, etc.  It really is a very comprehensive selection of products...and there are many items you won't find at a big box.

The staff is extremely helpful...today I was looking for a pedestal for a sundial and the staff went out of their way to assist me in what I was looking for.  I ended up leaving with a birdbath and Patty (?) spent a good amount of time helping...thank you!  It just is the sort of place for people who love gardening and the outdoors...impulse buying is very easy here.

Note of caution...in the spring on a weekend this place can get extremely crowded.  Getting assistance is definitely more an issue just due to volume. If you need help swing by during the week...they will take care of you.","I have a serious weakness for Culvers crinkle cut fries.

Stopped in here on a slow Saturday afternoon.  We came in around 2 pm to find more of the lunch crowd had left and there were just a few people having drinks around the bar.  We decided to seat ourselves in the bar area and look over the menu.

Something that turned me off immediately was when I ordered a beer (a sour) the bartender gave me the ""you're a girl and definitely won't like this face"" and suggested I try something else. Strike one.  I had the beer and enjoyed it, and did not appreciate someone telling me I ""might like something else more"".  

Their menu looked excellent.  There was something for everyone from your weird vegan cousin to your mom who thinks Applebee's is the epitome of fine dining.  Everyone is going to find something they liked.  I had a delicious sandwhich with some hearty steak fries and my better half enjoyed buffalo chili.  One thing I did not enjoy was paying a huge markup for Taste of Philly Pretzels with a side of some not-so-yummy pimento cheese dip.  I'll pass on that next time, and wouldn't recommend this app.

All in all it was a nice place to have a late lunch and enjoy some brews.  The seating in the bar area isn't very comfy (no backs on the chairs, just stools) so don't sit there if you're planning to stay a while.

 Also, make sure you ask for your check well before you need to leave.  It honestly took over 15 minutes from the time we told the server we were ready to leave to get our check and have our card run.  That is too long to wait for something like that, especially when the place is only moderately  busy.","Text1: Small restaurant in a strip mall.  Started with 3 great soups, Nan breads and 3 different entrees - malai kafta,  bangen Barta, mushroom kabob. 

Excellent!  Probably the best Indian vegetarian food I've had!

The Reverse Maki (rice on the outside) tend to have more fish than the Hoso Maki (seaweed on the outside), so opt for the former.

I stopped in here looking for leotards (hopefully something sparkly or USA themed - they had none of that) for my 8 year old's recent gymnastics obsession.

Now, part of this was my own damned fault as I was talking on my cell phone (engrossed actually) as I entered the store and basically waved at the woman and pointed to my phone.  I tried to wrap up the conversationbut the person went on and on and I dd eventually hang up.

By then the woman had wrttenme off - which kinda sucked, because I did end up finding 2 ""close-out sale"" short sleeved, solid-color, basic leotards at VERY inexpensive prices (and thus non-returnable).

They have a really good beer selection and I was happy that there was a lot of seating at the bar. The bartender seemed really friendly and laid back and was really good about being prompt with our order.

There are some great beer options, there is bbq, a few areas for children to play, stores, and federal donuts.

It was pretty good, in a ""cheesesteak from the pizza place down the street"" kind of way. It supposed to be, ""andouille sausage, steak, salami, onions, cheese, and creole mayo,"" but all you can taste in the steak and cheese with a little kick.

She let me try one of the fried ""shrimp"" that fell out. The breading was very tasty, but the ""shrimp"" tasted similar to that of what you'd find in a grocery store ramen noodles with fake shrimp package.

We also witnessed the ""waitress"" mess up everyone's orders and then do nothing to make up for it.

I stand by what I said last time, the Alligator Sausage Po Boy they're ""famous"" for was oddly devoid of alligator sausage and was mostly peppers and onions.

I imagine if you have more people or look like you're going to get smashed they'll start a tab and give you a check. It worked for me. I only wanted to try a few.

They have some neat shirts and whatnot.

The best beer I had was Cloudy with a Chance of Charcuterie, and it really blows that they didn't have it in cans (and when I asked the main location in Perkasie, they said it's scheduled for canning this week and will be both here and the main location with very limited distro).

The layout is very cool and presents patrons with a lovely ambiance.  It's not too loud or bright - at least when I have visited, and the staff is always very friendly.  They usually have you situated and beveraged within minutes.

Let's talk about the sweet, sweet tapas menu.  If one is questioning which tapas to partake in....let me guide you.  

These are my top 3..
1.  Bleu Cheese Stuffed, Applewood Smoked Bacon Wrapped Dates - if dining for two...order at least two of these amazing lil' nuggets.  You will thank me for it later.  I dream about these when I am not dining at Mojo.
2.  Beer Battered Grouper Bites w/Mustard Malt Vinegar Aioli.  They will make love to your mouth with every bite....seriously.
3.  New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp.  The name alone should suffice....delicious and fiery.  

I also thoroughly enjoyed the baked goat cheese with creole sauce & bread and the roasted veggie cakes.  There are so many others I intend to try, but I can never pull myself away from the top three.

Drinks...sweet Jesus...their mojitos will own you.  The mint mojito is amazing.  They also offer a lemon basil version if that floats your boat.  The sangria is also equally refreshing a well.  If you are feeling funky, they also have 1/2 price pitcher nights for margaritas (Monday), sangria (Tuesday), and mojitos (Thursday).  One can never beat half price pitchers of refreshing and delicious cocktails.

If you have always wanted to venture out and take your virginal tapas plunge - Mojo is a great place for it.  They are easy on the pocketbook and go above and beyond when it comes to quality and service.  The best part is you won't go away overstuffed and feeling gross nor will you go away hungry.  A few of these amazing tapas will put you right where you need to be.","Text1: Basic Spice is a nice, cozy place located in the South Grand area.  The staff are extremely friendly.  We even received a free order of spring rolls, which was nice.  The dumplings were also quite delicious.  

I am a coconut milk and curry fan and went for the Gang Dang (w/chicken), which was chocked full of various veggies and very tasty.  They also actually ask what heat level you prefer as far as the curry is concerned, which is an added plus considering some establishments do not.  The prices are a little steep but quality makes up for the added cost.  I will return to try another delicious curry entree in the near future! 

 Text2: How on earth did a review slip by me the first (two) times?  For shame!  I love this place.  Love it.  They are within striking distance from home and a nice addition to the arsenal of eateries on South Grand.  Oh where to begin...

The layout is very cool and presents patrons with a lovely ambiance.  It's not too loud or bright - at least when I have visited, and the staff is always very friendly.  They usually have you situated and beveraged within minutes.

Let's talk about the sweet, sweet tapas menu.  If one is questioning which tapas to partake in....let me guide you.  

These are my top 3..

1,"The special Bui sauce.. hm.. tangy, spicy, it's a mixture of some not so common Asian flavor. Price is cheap, but flavor is just ok. Also it only opens rush hours, so if the doors are shut, it means shut. I tried meatballs and some steak sandwiches. They are okay. I think meatballs is little heavy with binders and hard to taste the meat. I can tell the sauce is definitely some jar brand.","Excellent view of the city. I went there when it wasn't crazy busy.

1,"I don't know if it's actually that much cheaper than places on the hill. It has a bit less atmosphere, but it is very good food. 

Don't me wrong, if you brought an Italian here they might be highly offended. Even as an American, the sauces and cheese are not what I've experienced in any other city. St. Louis has to be the only place on earth that does Italian this way. It is more than just provel cheese that is different. 

That is so interesting though. And on a budget, with kids, or on their (Monday)? All you can eat deal, you might want to come to pasta house. 

We had excellent service at this location, a deal from groupon, and a quite tasty meal. I wish they still gave slu basketball discounts, and after this season they just might. They sure wouldn't have to give them often as slu may not score 60 points often. 

A local chain that makes St. Louis ""Italian"" well. Not everybody in the metro can always eat on the hill. My fiancé has loved the tortellini all her life. It's hard to try anything else after you've tried it.","Yummy bagels, soup, sandwich, coffee, and breakfast place. Very friendly staff. It was pretty similar to panera (bread co) just a bit of a smaller local chain. I'd have to go back several times to figure out all the differences.

Not exactly my kind of food, but it would be good to sit and work or meet up with a friend over coffee.

The roulette tables are electronic with no dealers, which was a tad different that I had experienced in various casinos in the past.

From the outside, it seems kind of quaint in a vintage sort of way, which holds true when you walk inside as well. However, the actual theatre rooms are like any other modern theatre rooms you would expect. Additionally, there are only four movies being screened at any given time, so you have to hope your top choice is playing.

The price is a bit outrageous, but that's to be expected for the Main Line. Sure, it's just as easy to wait for movies to stream online these days, but you're paying for the experience! What's a trip to the movies without popcorn, right?

I actually really like this movie theater and love to come with my friends every once in awhile.

When I first entered The Island, my eyes immediately went to the large dispenser containing clear refreshing liquid with thinly sliced cucumbers floating inside.

I have to admit I was disappointed, but once I sampled and filled my bowl with Froyo I was whisked away to a tropical ""island"". 

Those big chain Froyo shops have nothing on The Island, in fact The Island has them beat with flavor, toppings and customer service. I'm a purest,  I like my yogurt plain like my flavored vodka. I like to experience their true flavors to the fullest.

1,"If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix. 
You'll have three tacos; a chorizo, a carnitas, and a mixed-vegetable, along with rice and beans. As usual you'll get the flavorful house salad and a glass of iced tea. ( I love their salad dressing, wish it was available bottled.)
Now let's talk about the new blue plate itself. I'd be hard pressed to select which taco I thought was best, each was in a class of it's own.  I was surprised that I actually liked the vegetable taco. The broccoli had a crisp snap and the red pepper and onion added extra flavor.
The beans were just okay, need something to give it  a bang. Ask for their hot sauce, add it to the rice and you've got a great side to your tacos.

Their line was at the backdoor, and we were told it would be 45 minuets to an hour before we could be served. Sorry, but no BBQ is that good. So across the street we go to experience The Good Pie for the first time and we were glad we did.

This has to be the best pizza pie in Saint Louis. The ambiance is rustic and charming. I love the exposed brick and old bicycles as art. The tables are a mixture of high tops and regular height tables, we chose a high top. We could see the wood burning oven where they bake the pies from our table and it was fun to watch the chefs create masterful pies. 

We took advantage of the lunch special which is available 11AM till 1:30PM.  To experience two toppings we ordered one sausage and one Genoa salami and we each got the Caesar salad. I highly recommend adding white anchovies for an additional $2.50. It will add an extra kick to a already top notch Caesar. Keep in mind their dressing is house made and is done with raw eggs. If you forget, they have a raw egg warning on the menu. 

Both toppings kicked ass, but if i had to choose only one it would be the sausage. The fact that they use fresh Mozzarella Cheese, is awesome. What I found cool, is that the pies were not perfectly round, they had a slight oval or deformation. One of our pies was slightly burned on the edges, it added character and flavor. 

Our server was friendly and to our surprise as we chatted, we found out he was one of the owners.  We continued to chat through out our lunch and he ask us to share our honest opinion with him before we left. We told him, we'd be back and that they truly had the best pizza pie in the Lou.

Now we need to go experience their other restaurant, Half & Half and if it is half as good as The Good Pie it too will blow my taste buds.","Text1: If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix. 
You'll have three tacos; a chorizo, a carnitas, and a mixed-vegetable, along with rice and beans. As usual you'll get the flavorful house salad and a glass of iced tea. ( I love their salad dressing, wish it was available bottled.)
Now let's talk about the new blue plate itself. I'd be hard pressed to select which taco I thought was best, each was in a class of it's own.  I was surprised that I actually liked the vegetable taco. The broccoli had a crisp snap and the red pepper and onion added extra flavor.
The beans were just okay, need something to give it  a bang. Ask for their hot sauce, add it to the rice and you've got a great side to your tacos.

Don't me wrong, if you brought an Italian here they might be highly offended. Even as an American, the sauces and cheese are not what I've experienced in any other city. St. Louis has to be the only place on earth that does Italian this way. It is more than just provel cheese that is different. 

That is so interesting though. And on a budget, with kids, or on their (Monday)? All you can eat deal, you might want to come to pasta house. 

We had excellent service at this location, a deal from groupon, and a quite tasty meal. I wish they still gave slu basketball discounts, and after this season they just might. They sure wouldn't have to give them often as slu may not score 60 points often. 

A local chain that makes St. Louis ""Italian"" well. Not everybody in the metro can always eat on the hill. My fiancé has loved the tortellini all her life. It's hard to try anything else after you've tried it.","Howl is so much fun! I've been to the location in Boston and this is the perfect addition to the Philly night scene. It took over Bucca de Beppo's lot so it's pretty spacious. Depending on your arrival time you may have to wait in line, but it moves quickly. There's a $5 cover but during their opening month they have a coupon on their Facebook page for free admission. The performers were awesome, but as the first review said they're more like a cover band than dueling pianos. Regardless, very entertaining and a ton of fun to dance and sing along. The area in front of the stage is really loud and gets pretty hot, but the rest of the bar is fine. The drinks were expensive and not strong, which was disappointing. The speciality drink there is the huge bucket of booze, meant to serve 4 people. Tasty, but again, not strong enough.

Sometimes I come here to shop.

Once in awhile I come here to eat.

Rarely do I combine two of the above activities here at the Summit, but it's pretty dead handy when I do.  My favorite stores are the Apple and Old Navy stores.  I love the little doggie park and the mini putt putt green they have at that end of the mall. Just a nice extra thoughtful touch.

Unlike other people, I am not one of those people who delight in leisurely walking from shop to shop, spending 45 minutes here, 25 minutes there, and dangling multiple shopping bags from my arm, leaving red marks on my skin.  

That is not my idea of fun; therefore the idea of walking from store to store doesn't bother me.

0,Good Korean food in Nashville. The Bi Bim Bop is good and great sauces. Very hospitable staff.,"I would definitely have to agree with Byron J. on this one (we seem to frequent many of the same locations)...

I live about 2 miles from Five Guys and I rarely crave red meat, but when I do, I make an effort to have a burger...when Five Guys got to town, my hubby and I were very excited to give it a go.

We've tried it on SEVERAL occasions.  First of all, I know they make everything to order, but they are SLOW.  This is kind of annoying when I just want to grab and go...SECOND, it is underwhelmingly decent but not a fantastic burger.  

When a place SPECIALIZES in one thing, I think it should be done PERFECT, every time, no exception.  The one thing I do like about the burgers is the bacon.  They do the bacon AWESOME.  Everything else is just average, which is fairly disappointing considering it's ALL they do.

I also think it's ironic that they BOAST about how fabulous they are on every wall. Too bad none of those are local.  Maybe I'll check out a Five Guys in another city, but I would recommend Hardees over this joint and they are a LOT faster!","Text1: Good Korean food in Nashville.

I came here for the Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  The noodles were fabulous.  They were homemade and had the right amount of bite to them.  The soup was so tasty.

I would definitely go back there, but never get a po-boy again. Next time I will opt for the jambalaya, gator gumbo, or blackened chicken alfredo. 5 stars based on the samples, 1.5 based on the po-boy. Guess you never know until you try! 

 Text2: Fabulous store.  Lots of cute clothing and toys, all mixed up boutique style.  Lolli Lolli is the perfect place to buy a baby gift.  They have it all, and the SA's are super helpful.

Minus one star because there are 5-6 steps at the entrance to the store, making it impossible to browse if you have a stroller with you.  Hello!  Mom's always have strollers.  I bet they're turing away tons of would be browsers!",no
0,"A friend told me about the Honu last night on FB, given that I adore Hawai'ian inspired food, I made the decision to go today! I'm really glad I did. 

It's located right off Main street in Dunedin, in an adorable cottage/bungalo that is very welcoming and bright. Parking might be difficult at first, but Dunedin has plenty of street and public parking so that's that. 

Once inside, I was seated and the specials were gone over.  The menu itself was quite extensive too!  I decided I wanted to do things the Hawai'ian way, and went for the plate lunch: Agave Pork, green goddess slaw and potato mac salad.  The table next to me, three wonderful ladies also made the same order, so we shared in the community of the same food and chatted while we waited. 

When the food was delivered, it was obviously made fresh, smelled great and tasted even better! The green goddess slaw was unlike anything I'd ever had before! It was light, fresh and tangy, the flavor was bright on the tongue and I really couldn't get enough. The Potato-mac salad was out of this world.  The agave pork was a bit on the sweet side, but I liked it fine. 

I actually ate every scrap of food on my plate, the portions were JUST right!  I opted for dessert, because really who can resist? I chose their ""that's how the cookie crumbles"" Which was immense! warm chocolate chip cookies, fresh whipped cream.. all served sundae style. Honestly it would only be made better if they sold it WITH their macadamia nut ice cream!

Over all, the food and the service were absolutely amazing! I will most certainly be back","I heard through facebook at Gypsy Saloon had a $20 four course brunch that included all you can drink mimosa's and bloody marys. I had to try it out. My friend and I went around 12:30. The restuarant was about half full and the manager greeted me at the door and showed me to my table. I ordered a mimosa and my friend joined a few minutes later and she ordered one as well. 

They were served in large wine glass. Light on the champagne, but very tasty. The four course brunch menu consisted of breads and pastries, yogurt, main course, and mini cupcakes. 

We received our bread and pastries. They were good, but similar to packaged bread and mini muffins. We have a couple and waited for the next course. They brought out yogurt with fresh blackberries, blueberries, and a sttrawberry, served in a cute martini glass. The yogurt didn't have a lot of flavor, but the fresh fruit was tasty. 

I ordered the mexican burrito served with breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were crispy to my liking. The burrito was large, but we noticed some of the ingradients were missing like the avocado cream and sour cream. We mentioned it to ther server and they brought it right out. The burrito was good, nothing to rave about. I was certainly full.

They brought out a plate of four mini cupcakes, but I was so full I wrapped them up for my kids at home. 

The food was average, service was good, but the drinks made it all worth it. I would go again, and maybe try their aparagus and goat cheese quiche next time. 

PS. I've been there for happy hour and I highly suggest trying the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. It's out of this world.","Text1: A friend told me about the Honu last night on FB, given that I adore Hawai'ian inspired food, I made the decision to go today! I'm really glad I did.

Soups, salads, and sandwiches! Perfect spot for a quick lunch. Place looks clean and well kept. Menu has plenty of choices for anyone.

I ordered broccoli and cheddar soup with a half croissant chicken sandwich. The soup was oh so delicious! The croissant was good too, but it felt like it was missing something bc it was a lil bit on the drier side. The size they give you for lunch is perfect! Not so heavy that you are returning to work and wanna pass out. lol. Next time I go, I will get a salad. So many salads were ordered while I was eating and they all looked soooooo delicious!

Another plus...they take level up. If you don't have level up yet, go there, download the app, and scan the code to get $5 off! :-)",Ambiance is a little old school. Food was decent. I had the turkey burger which was was really thick and topped with feta cheese and red peppers. My coworker ordered the turkey sandwich which looked better than mine. Another coworker got the Buffalo Chicken wrap which was HUGE and it looked delish. Our waitress was pretty rude - did not say one word to us the entire time and didn't acknowledge our order. Definitely would not go back.,"Text1: OMG.....THEY ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSED. Wanted to go today, walked by and was soo dissappointed. Sigh

1,"I have given good reviews to Maher in the past, and generally have had good experiences. However, they always gave out free rental vehicles while getting and oil change and this perk was one of the reasons I held such a high opinion of Maher Chevrolet. I learned a couple mornings ago, that is no longer the case. Without that perk, I am seriously disappointed, but I realize this was a rather rare perk for a Chevy Dealership. 

While I have had a few frustrating moments here, who is lucky enough to deal with a car dealership, or service department without a little frustration? Generally, I have very good experiences and have been a loyal customer of the service department since 2009 (when I moved to Florida). I also leased my 2014 Cruze here last year. While I do not think I got the best deal in the world, I will assign that blame to the sales man doing a good job and my lack of patience with bargaining when it is only a lease and I will be giving it back. 

So my most recent experience was a little less than stellar. I tried booking an appointment online instead of over the phone. I had some notes in the bottom notes section advising of my need for a rental car and stressing that I would need to reschedule my appointment if there was no rental. My notes about the rental car went unnoticed and so when I arrived, after sitting around for 15 minutes as phone calls were made during my blocked off appointment time, I learned of the policy change and I had to cancel my appointment and I was still late to work. 

I was not a happy camper and emailed a complaint through their website. I waited a maybe 30 minutes and after getting no response decided I would post my complaint here. I did and Maher Chevrolet quickly reached out to me. After a little bit of phone tag, I spoke with the manager. He was very apologetic and I was very appreciative. Obviously they cannot change a policy just for me, and I did not expect them to. I will be happy just knowing that they will review the notes section in more detail in the future and promptly advise when requests cannot be met. Even if they cannot call you, the moment you arrive for you appointment, someone working in the service department should quickly advise you that your request cannot be met, so you do not waste time sitting around only to learn you cannot be helped. As a side note, the dealership should contact the 3rd party that makes the maintenance software to get changes. Either (1) remove the notes section completely, because there are no flags to catch the service advisers attention, the notes section is at the very bottom and easy to miss; or (2) ADD SOME KIND OF FLAG. Obviously I prefer adding some sort of flag, but if that is too problematic, then just remove the notes all. If I were unable to leave notes, then I would be forced to call and there would be a higher likelihood it does not fall under the radar.

Still, Maher has great customer service with a friendly attitude. The dealership is a clean and updated. Despite the fact that my parents hope to retire from GM soon, they will be moving down here and will remain loyal to GM even if I may not. I am sure once they get down here from Detroit, they will bring their new Equinox in for service. I am seriously impressed with the quality of my Cruze LS compared to my prior Chevy Aveo.","Once I heard that USPS was going to get rid of this location. I lived right around the corner, and this was very disappointing to me. I came here often. Sometimes to get stamps, sometimes just to have them weigh my parcel so I did not accidentally put to much postage on it. All things considered, I was happy this place was so close, but always a bit annoyed when I had to come here.

In the age of Fedex and UPS, lots of people criticize USPS. Here is something that I love about them: the one-rate boxes. They have boxes that you can cram as much stuff as possible into and it is always the same rate.

Here is the problem with USPS. Fedex and UPS are much more conveniently located and spread throughout cities. I was lucky to have USPS so close, but not that lucky. Because this is the main branch, it would ALWAYS be packed. Most recently I was here bright and early at 8am. There was only one employee working and I had about 4 people in front of me. I am thankful the employee was cheerful and SO FAST. She really did a good job. I only waited about 10 minutes. By the time I left, the line behind me was twice as long. It will probably get worse as the day goes on, but more employees will join her at the counter. 

I recall that since I was a little kid, I have never been to a Post Office that did not have a huge line. That is why I used to despise going there when I was little. I still feel that same angst as I walk through to automatic doors. 

Michael S. is right to point out that they sure do have a TON of P.O. Boxes. And I never recall being uncomfortably warm while waiting in the huge lines, so he must also be right about the air conditioning. 

Overall, I like the employees at this Post Office. They are friendly and really kick butt doing their job while keeping customers happy. I also truly hope they decided (or decide) not to close down this branch. While I do not live as close as I used to, I can only imagine that the crowds at other Post Offices will only get 100 times worse if this branch is closed. Sometime less is more, but I guarantee that saying will not hold true for the number of Post Offices that the government has in any given region.

1,"The Breakfast & Lunch Nook opened three weeks ago in what used to be called the Pita Hut in the Town and Country Shopping Center at Kietzke and Vassar.
It serves breakfast and lunch, both all hours it is open. It's a minimal menu serving diner food but they seem to do it well.
I tried it for breakfast today and got eggs, a hamburger patty, hash browns and a half order of biscuits and gravy. The hamburger patty was lean and well cooked, the eggs were eggs. The hash browns were the only part of the meal I didn't like. Kind of gooey and I didn't like the taste.
The biscuits and gravy were excellent, maybe the best in town. The gravy is obviously made from scratch with nice chunks of sausage and soft biscuits. 
The lunch menu is pretty simple as well. Open-faced sandwiches, hamburger or other sandwiches, salads. It's diner food done right.","Three stars for the pizza, four stars for the buffalo chicken wings.
The pizza was good. The toppings weren't the best. But the dough, sauce and cheese were nice. I got a regular combination and that isn't the specialty here. They're best with the Californicated pizzas I don't like.
The chicken wings were really good and that's what I get if I came back. Good meat flavor. Maybe some of the best quality chicken wings I've seen in the area. And the buffalo wings had a nice zing.","Text1: The Breakfast & Lunch Nook opened three weeks ago in what used to be called the Pita Hut in the Town and Country Shopping Center at Kietzke and Vassar.

My dinner date ordered the Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops with Mashed Potatoes on the side. The service was friendly and speedy. My water glass was kept filled and the bread here is always fresh and good. The pork chops were very well liked as was my pasta. The only thing I will say though is I felt the portion was extremely small for a $20 plate of pasta. They are always busy though. Clearly I'm in the minority. Be careful in that bar. A cougar might get you.","Yep, one of the most underrated happy hours in the city.  Now granted, there is plenty of room, not crowded until later, and you are not going to find a host of singles to fulfill your alcohol induced desires.  But to meet a friend in old city, a young, sexy blonde friend who just wants to hang on to your arm and stare into your blue eyes, and to be able to hear each other converse (hey millennials, do you know what 'converse' means), a cool, relaxed happy hour atmosphere is what you have.

$3 beers, and I mean REAL beers like Terrapin Hi-5 IPA (normally $7), and on Thursday The Twisted Tail's version of a classic cocktail like a Manhattan for $5, you kidding me?  The red wine on special blew, so knock yourself out and pay retail for something.  $4-$6 small happy hour food items on the menu.  We had $6 for 6 oysters, tender, nice sized blue points, great cocktail and hot sauces.  (That's a buck-a-shuck, for those counting at home).  The chorizo taco was very nice, very tender, a good split just for a taste.  The spicy salmon poke was average, missing something, some sort of tangy bite I think.  

From the regular menu, the harpoon-caught swordfish was 5 star all the way, with perfectly, and I mean perfectly cooked, snappy snap peas.  The fish so tender and fresh, so melt in your mouth with exceptional taste-bud tingling, one of the best I've ever had.

After drinking a ton of $3 beers, my appetite was still alive, had to try the desserts.  We split two: Pecan Pie with caramel sauce...the crust a little stiff, the insides delicious; and the ricotta beignets...not too sweet, a wonderful cap  to the evening as the live music started.","Text1: I ate an early dinner at Brio on a Saturday evening.

0,"I've kind of got a food crush on Bailey's. 

    After running the Tap 'N' Run 4K my friends and I were, well, drunk. And what do you need after a good beer run? A burger. So we decided this was as good a time as any to give Bailey's Range our undivided, starving attention. 
   When we walked in we were absolutely charmed by the atmosphere. The open space is great--big open windows, and the second story catwalk above that you can dine at is pretty awesome as well. We sat at the long main dining table by the kitchen area so we got to watch the chefs and admire their expansive collection of windows. I'm a fan of that sort of thing. 
       Our waitress dropped off our little mason jars full of water and left us two jugs (smart cookie!). A little bit after, she returned to take our order and I decided to try the Sweet Smoke Burger with a small fry and the Hot/Sweet sauce. The Sweet Smoke comes with an onion ring...so that's where I was at, a greasy, delicious concoction that I could only justify at this point in time. When my fries came, I tried the Hot/Sweet sauce but I was not a fan at all. One of my friends enjoyed it but it was a little too honey mustard yet spiced for me...just not sweeping my tastebuds off their feet. So I asked for BBQ and she promptly brought me a different mini-jar full. 
    Besides that mishap, my burger and fries were pretty freakin' good. The service was good and she always came around to check on us after a bit (it wasn't all too busy so she could've came after serving us to ask how everything was), but all in all a great first experience at Bailey's. 

    Next time I am determined to try a shake....and leave my leopard print tights and tutu at home.","Can't go wrong with Yats! Love this Indy-famous spot. My favorite is 1/2 and 1/2 with Drunken Chicken and B&B. Bread is delicious and on special days, I add on the peanut butter pie. I am so happy this location takes credit cards now because I always had to remember to get cash. Great food, friendly staff, and happy me!","Text1: I've kind of got a food crush on Bailey's.

0,"If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix. 
You'll have three tacos; a chorizo, a carnitas, and a mixed-vegetable, along with rice and beans. As usual you'll get the flavorful house salad and a glass of iced tea. ( I love their salad dressing, wish it was available bottled.)
Now let's talk about the new blue plate itself. I'd be hard pressed to select which taco I thought was best, each was in a class of it's own.  I was surprised that I actually liked the vegetable taco. The broccoli had a crisp snap and the red pepper and onion added extra flavor.
The beans were just okay, need something to give it  a bang. Ask for their hot sauce, add it to the rice and you've got a great side to your tacos. 
This place is still the best value for lunch.","Monthly lunch with my fellow colleagues the other day and the person assigned to get lunch ordered from Fresh and had it delivered. 

My selection was the Chopped Italian salad. The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!

I do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches.","Text1: If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix.

1,"I am an avid wine taster in Santa Barbara and I LOVE this place!!!!   They do flights rather than a broad based tasting.  If you want to taste Pinots you can do the Pinot flight, if you want to do whites... well you get the picture.  The cheap flights (including beer) are $5 so you can do two for $10 (six wines) and if you want to taste wine that sells for $100 a bottle you pay a little more.  If you go often they change their wines monthly so you will never have to taste the same wine twice! 

The people who work there are friendly and very knowledgable and the place is beautiful!  On a foggy June day you can sit by the fire to do your tastings!","Congratulations Corks n' Crowns on winning Santa Barbara's heart and being named the #1 tasting room in the Independent readers Poll!!!  I couldn't agree more!   

The funk zone has matured from a sleepy little baby to a fun and rambunctious teenager.    And Corks n' Crowns has been there through the transformation, in fact I think that they are a huge part of that transformation.

I would suggest that if you enjoy wine or are seeking knowledge about wine that you go to Corks on a weekday afternoon.   Several of the tasting room employees have been studying wines in their spare time and have their Sommelier credentials.   You can seriously learn a great deal from their knowledge.   

Weekends Corks is the go-to place.  Of all of the Santa Barbara tasting rooms they tend to be the busiest.   Sometimes they are even at capacity and you might have to wait for an opportunity to go in.   It seems that on weekends a glass of wine or beer is the way to go rather than a tasting.    

I would encourage anyone, especially Santa Barbara locals to join the wine club.  Since they are a tasting room and not a winery, they never have to unload bad product.  100% of their wines are exceptional 100% of the time.  The memberships range from ridiculously reasonable to very extravagant depending on which one you choose.   The international membership is a real bargain if you are on a budget.  Corks has a very generous free tasting policy for members.","Text1: I am an avid wine taster in Santa Barbara and I LOVE this place!!!!   They do flights rather than a broad based tasting.

Whether you're a vegetarian/vegan or carnivore... you have to admit this meat-free burger is simply delicious.

It's situated downtown, so you can show up early and walk around before you head in for your show.

So I said, 'why the hell not'? So that, accompanied with green beans and a side salad came up to $9.27 after tax. Scoring a meal for under ten dollars anywhere these days is a rare occurrence for me.

Inside definitely feels like a diner, but I will say, things were smelling pretty good. Could have been that i was athirst for nourishment,  but the nose rarely confuses.

Got everything back to my house and it was all very good, I was rather pleased with the meal.

1,"To add to the already abundant selection of sub/sandwich places in a 1 mile radius, we now have PJ Subs (like it says on the menu) or T6 like it says on the front of the restaurant.  After kicking out my favorite wing joint, I just had to see if it was worth it..

They remodeled the store, adding central air conditioning, painting the walls, making the entrance ""prettier,"" decorating the walls with classic car paraphernalia, and most importantly, cleaning the bathroom.  They have new chairs and shiny new tables.

The front of the store has a neon lit sign that says 76.  Nowhere that I can find does it say PJ Subs other than on the front of the menu.  So really, I don't know what this place is called.  After hours of deliberation with my friend's roommate, we came to the conclusion that the ""76"" is actually a ""T6,"" which would stand for Tucson and 6th, the location of this sub joint.

Their menu consists of subs (cold or hot, from $5-8) and sides.  In addition they have salads and wings.  The bread is baked fresh, the vegetables are fresh, and the meats and cheeses are high quality.

My favorite is ""The Regular"" which has salami, capicolla, provolone, and the standard lettuce/tomato/onion.  They also put oil/vinegar on it and I asked for mayo (no charge).  It was presented open faced and looked very appetizing.  I could taste the quality in the meats and this was not as greasy as Silvermine or Jimmy John's version of the same sandwich.  Most of the cold sandwiches are a different combination of the same meats and cheeses, I've tried all of them and can't distinguish a huge difference in any of them.

The wings are alright, good enough to validate eating fried fat but not good enough to eat them alone as a meal.  The garlic bread is another item to miss.

PJ's officially opened on Monday, 1/5, and are still under construction.  The front of the store is complete, but they're still working on the heaters and a beer area in the back.  Nimis beer owns the store, and they will be brewing beer locally and selling it here.  In addition they will offer a selection of wines.","The first time I tried this place I was in love.

Most of the cold sandwiches are a different combination of the same meats and cheeses, I've tried all of them and can't distinguish a huge difference in any of them.

The wings are alright, good enough to validate eating fried fat but not good enough to eat them alone as a meal.  The garlic bread is another item to miss.

PJ's officially opened on Monday, 1/5, and are still under construction.  The front of the store is complete, but they're still working on the heaters and a beer area in the back.  Nimis beer owns the store, and they will be brewing beer locally and selling it here.  In addition they will offer a selection of wines. 

 Text2: The first time I tried this place I was in love.  I had sesame chicken and it was almost the best I've ever had.  So I came here again.  Not good.  I must have been really hungry to think the food here was that good.

The food is alright and the delivery has always been slow.",yes

The park is home to a Saturday market that is fun and well attended. The grounds are very well maintained and well laid out to support the many cultural events that take place here. The trolley goes right by the park, creating very easy access.","I came here for dinner with a group. The restaurant really specializes in seafood boils with you being able to make your own combination choosing from first the seafood like crab, lobster, crawfish, shrimp, mussels, 2) the sauce you want it cooked in like Old Bay, Cajun, or garlic butter, and 3) then select the add-ons like sausage, corn, potato. Three of us decided to split a seafood bake with crab legs and mussels. 

The only minor complaint was the service-our waiter didn't refill our waters or give us napkins even after we asked about 5 times. We would definitely go here again but that is annoying.","Text1: This is more a venue than a park.

The prices are more reasonable than flea markets these days, so you do not have to worry about breaking the bank. If you're looking for vintage/retro antiques then this is the place to go.","The Eagles started out as such a strong team this year! I went to a couple of preseason games and was impressed by what we had. So much skill! The rookies we picked up are great and our starters are still strong. 

Now if only we could get rid of McNabb. The tie against the Bengals did it for me. Too much embarrassment. I still root for them and still wish they win (especially against the Cowboys) but I wouldn't pay to watch another game at the Linc this season. Its much easier to take the defeat at home. I watch every game and anticipate a win. I'm just tired of the disappointment. There were many games we could have won but didn't. I'm tired of McNabb's low throws. How is a receiver supposed to catch the ball and continue running if its thrown at the floor? Lets face it, McNabb folds under pressure and that's whats preventing us from winning more games. 

The Eagles have no chance this year...but maybe next year!","Text1: A lot bigger than their South Street and Piazza stores, which is an awesome thing.

The best deals are during Happy Hour - the $3, $5 & $7 Margarita's.  I also believe wings are 1/2 off.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders of Burritos, Gaucamole and enchiladas.  

The food is average and for the price of drinks - it would be a great place to hang if the service improves.","Conveniently located across from Busch Gardens, this fast food Mediterranean restaurant serves some yummy falafel Sammie's!  Made fresh so you can customize. Comes with hummus if you like and Mediterranean style pickles. 

Also got a Greek salad that I saved for later consumption. Kareem is a jokester and kept me laughing while taking order.

0,"FINALLY!

This salon has everything that I want (except a debit/credit card machine)...

1. It's in my neighborhood and there's plenty of parking around.

2. The decor is welcoming and rustic. You can tell they're not trying too hard (like Salon Blush) but it's also not grimy or under-decorated (Shampoo Bar Salon & Spa).

3. They use natural products that don't smell toxic or abrasive. 

4. They let people bring their doggies inside. There were two dogs when I was there, and they were just running around being playful and entertaining.

5. They open at 9 am on Saturdays. With so many people having Saturday weddings that start in the afternoon it can be really hard to secure a 10:00 hair appointment just to have it last an hour and then have to rush home and do your makeup and get dressed before hitting the road to get to the wedding. The 9:00 open-time is a real blessing.

Now onto brass tacks... I saw Bridget for an updo for a wedding and couldn't have been happier. She was super friendly and tried very hard to accommodate me. She stopped what she was doing several times to have me check the progress and point out what I liked or didn't like. When she was done and I was doing my final check she told me that if I didn't like it she would ""take it all out and start over."" That wasn't necessary, but it was really nice to have someone actually care more about whether their client liked the product than to just churn people out as fast as possible.

The cherry on top is that all of the ladies that work there are super cute! It's always nice to go get your hair done by someone that actually looks good themselves. 

The next time I'm due for a haircut I'm going to try them out and see if I am still as happy. I suspect I will be!","Fun place to go to catch up with friends! Pretty setting and have yet to be disappointed with food. A little pricey but the food always seems quality. Had the small goat cheese salad, tiny but ate up every single bit of it! Then shared cheesesteak egg rolls, served with a horseradish sauce that was mild and not too overpowering. Finished off with my favorite dessert! Warm Banana bread
Pudding! They took it off the menu for about 6 months but now it's back! 

Parking is tight. You can make reservations through yelp, the weekends get very busy so do it while you can! Valet available for 5 dollars but at catelli.","Text1: FINALLY!

0,"Came here with a friend of mine before doing a salt float. We chose it because it was close and our original destination was closed because it was a holiday. 

Chili's wasn't busy, and we were seated rather quickly. Both of us perused the new menu, neither of us saw what we really wanted but did notice that there was a lunch menu that offered relatively cheap food for a low price.  

The server was concientious and quick, but the food was mediocre at best. My friend opted for the fajitas on the lunch menu with the side of rice and beans - Cadillac style, and was disappointed to find out that the rice was hard, as if it was old and had set out and dried.","This is a cool place.  I wonder how many people know that an Ouzaria is?  The ambience here is definitely upbeat - I'd rate it a great place for a group or first date.  They have a couple of semi-secluded tables in the back room that keeps it from getting too loud, but it's not a quiet romantic place.  

We brought my Mother-in-Law, who enjoys good food as long as it's not too weird.  I guess my wife is about the same, now that I think about it.  We tried three tapas plates; a three-cheese sampler, featuring feta, goat cheese and kasseri cheese, greek meatballs and pan-seared scallops.  We liked all three of these dishes.  The scallops were especially good - big and tender.   For tapas, they were pretty big portions, so keep this in mind.  The waitress suggested ordering one thing at a time, but we didn't heed her advice and ordered it all up front.   Two at a time would probably be a good idea.  Along with the tapas, we ordered a traditional Greek salad, which ended up being the lone clunker, surprisingly.  We just didn't like the dressing - too sweet for our tastes.  The gyro meat was fine, though, so maybe we'll just get a gyro next time.   One more thing:  The Spanish granacha (can't remember the label) was excellent for just $6 and a nice pour. 

Okay, now for the belly dancer:  She was cute and a good dancer, but I think this is just something that requires more alcohol on my part.  We did have a few laughs about it, though.  I opted not to get a dollar out to stuff in her skirt or whatever.   Fun but a little awkward. 

I've been to a few other Greek places in town that had better food, but for a night out, Momo's is definitely the choice.

I'm a fancy cocktail guy.  There are a plenty of options in the city if you know where to look.  They all have some attributes in common: drinks are $10-$15 each, heavy on the liquor, high on the flavor.  The atmosphere also has standards, for example no standing and the requirement that you dress like you belong.  Therefore, it should be no surprise that Tipping Place has all of these.

So what exactly has me giving Tippling a ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" rating?  Unlike some of the other cocktail bars in the city, you can actually come in and look around instead of waiting in line outside.  May not seem like much, but it is nice in the winter and means you can be late to meeting up with friends without feeling like you're holding them back from grabbing a drink.  Another little thing, I like their seats.  Yes, some of the old timy furniture could use an update, but they are damn comfortable. 

The drinks are fancy and I like them regardless of how they make me look (with the occasional 'girly' glass in front of me).  I like how Tippling has a regular menu along with Special/Seasonal drinks.  It is nice to find your old favorite once in a while.  Beyond that, service is reasonable and location is convenient.

Great wine by the glass, tasting flights measured to perfection and an impressive selection of liquor as well. I went craving a red wine, but when I saw they offered Tito's Vodka my favorite I was swayed away. 

We enjoyed a sampling of artisan cured meats and hard cheese served with fresh bread and oil. 

A great place for Happy Hour or after theater drinks.","Disclaimer: The decanter at the front door is not cucumber infused vodka. 

When I first entered The Island, my eyes immediately went to the large dispenser containing clear refreshing liquid with thinly sliced cucumbers floating inside.  I jokingly asked, ""is that cucumber infused vodka?"".  The jovial cashier, gave a hearty laugh and informed me it was ""just water"". I have to admit I was disappointed, but once I sampled and filled my bowl with Froyo I was whisked away to a tropical ""island"". 

Those big chain Froyo shops have nothing on The Island, in fact The Island has them beat with flavor, toppings and customer service. I'm a purest,  I like my yogurt plain like my flavored vodka. I like to experience their true flavors to the fullest. 

My ""island"" experience included; Madagascar Vanilla, Root Beer Float and Cheesecake. The Root Beer Float was as if you truly were having one, except it was all yogurt and no soda. If you crumbled up some graham crackers with the cheesecake, you'd think you were eating the real thing. However, the Madagascar Vanilla was my favorite, it had true vanilla flavoring. Even as a child my favorite ice cream was vanilla, I guess old habits are hard to break.

1,"This place has a few redeeming qualities such as:

1. Good beer selection/everything drink selection
2. Generally great screens
3. Great seating options
4. Super fast food
5. Decent parking in the back.

However, there are major draw backs that makes this a place a I rather not go to unless I have to, but I will happily go to if friends make me go here:

1. The food is overly salty and seasoned like you won't believe...
2. Servers bust their butt, but on busy nights, there just aren't enough of them. Or even on slow, nights, there still aren't enough. Poor people management is one of my biggest pet peeves.
3. They are actually kinda rude to smaller groups. I understand you want to make money, but reservations are reservations.

Service might be a bit slow at times (especially if you have a crush of people), but I have never waited longer than 10 min in line. However what makes this place simply awesome is its TACOS... I have been here four times. What makes this a Nashville staple that I always come to is that the tacos are always taste fresh and well balanced with flavor and seasonings. 

It is a great bang for you buck sober or less than so. It might not be San Antonio glory exactly, but between the unique experience the piping hot delights... its worth it.","Text1: This place has a few redeeming qualities such as:

1. Good beer selection/everything drink selection
2. Generally great screens
3. Great seating options
4. Super fast food
5. Decent parking in the back.

However, there are major draw backs that makes this a place a I rather not go to unless I have to, but I will happily go to if friends make me go here:

1. The food is overly salty and seasoned like you won't believe...
2. Servers bust their butt, but on busy nights, there just aren't enough of them. Or even on slow, nights, there still aren't enough. Poor people management is one of my biggest pet peeves.
3. They are actually kinda rude to smaller groups. I understand you want to make money, but reservations are reservations.

1,"I just cannot like this place. On my third visit, I ordered a peanut butter shake, the whiskey BBQ burger medium rare, and small fries with Sriracha ketchup.

The shake was good.

The burger came out almost WELL DONE FOR THE THIRD VISIT IN A ROW, and the meat tasted off--almost kind of rotten. Way too greasy too.

My friend and I also almost didn't get our fries until I flagged down a waitress to ask about them. Could not really taste the Sriracha in my Sriracha ketchup, if that's what was brought out. :\","This place is legit! The portions are good for the price, the service is friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly. The space is small, so there is often a waiting list, but it's worth the wait. I do wish there were more vegetable dishes on the menu. Vegetarians will have a hard time here.","Text1: I just cannot like this place.

1,"I was thrilled to find myself near HipCityVedge right before the lunch rush the other day. I'm a lady who loves her meat AND veggies so I've been eager to give this place a try. 

I walked into a small, clean, friendly store and went with the Crispy Ranch Chick'n Burger. Delicious. It came out, hot, crispy and covered in this delicious ranch sauce. I loved it. I loved every bite. Yes, it was pricey for a sandwich but it was absolutely delicious. 

I'm really looking forward to the next time I find myself in the neighborhood at lunch time!","I was beyond thrilled when I heard about Emmanuelle coming to the piazza. I have always thought that Nolibs was in desperate need of a place to go and grab cocktails. When it comes to beer, you're covered but a cocktail place was lacking...until now. 

Upon walking in, this bar manages to be a perfect mix of comfortable and sexy. The atmosphere makes me want to sit down and have some drinks. Perfect. My only wish is that the bar was bigger. It gets crammed and I think they should take one stool out.

The cocktails are delicious though I've been stuck on the Framboise. It's some bubbly with fresh lemon juice and a raspberry liquor. Its refreshing but not too sweet. It's subtle. I love it. Other than that, they have something for everyone from what I can tell. The bartenders are inviting and know how to mix a cocktail paying attention to every little detail. They have also been helpful for suggestions which is great. 

I will absolutely continue to come back to this place. I only worry that once the word is out, it will get jammed packed as it's pretty small.","Text1: I was thrilled to find myself near HipCityVedge right before the lunch rush the other day.

1,"While Han in Olde City is an eccentric, bossy, know-it-all kinda host. Catherina in University City is the most friendly, welcoming hostess you could find in any restaurants. Han Dynasty in UCity is definitely better than the original since it's a lot loftier with free parking, a nice bar area, a higher end venue altogether. It always have space to accommodate a large party like my friends and I. The staff here is way more professional. Instead of giving off that ""you're lucky to dine here"" vibe, they give you a sense that they really want you to be there. 

My favorite dish is still the double cook fish, the sesame noodle, beef and tripe in chili oil and pork belly in garlic sauce, but they have an UCity specific special menu with special items. During Chinese new year, they had a special special menu with stir-fried razor clams shaped like a peacock that was superb. Fried Taiwanese sausage is sweet and unlike the traditional Chinese sausages I had. Three cup chicken is also sweet little chunks of delights.

With such a welcoming crew, no wonder Han Dynasty is expanding and opening up more and more stores catering to people who wants to add more spice in their life. One of them just happens to be Jose Garces. I spotted him and his family dining the other night and I was star struck only to be too chicken s#*t and too polite to disrupt a family dinner to get my pictures taken with him. But if the Iron Chef comes here for his kick, it must be good, right?","The thing about Kanella is strange. The restaurant is only half a block to my apartment, so I pass by it all the time and after trying it for the very first time when it first opened. I couldn't honestly call myself a fan. What can I say? I ordered the kebob and everybody who knows anything about Greek/Turkish food is that kebobs are the most generic thing on the menu and can't really reflect the skills of the chef. On top of that the restaurant is popular and the space is small with tables arranged very closed to each other and I'm a bit claustrophobic. At the end of the meal I freaked out  a little and had to run out of the restaurant to catch a breath. After that experience I was a bit afraid to go back. Then there was a pretty long and angry respond to a newspaper review that got pasted on the window of the kitchen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got weirded out by it.

It wasn't until Food Network's The Best Thing I've Ever Ate that got me pay more attention to my Greek neighbor. I went back for the Cyprus breakfast promoted by the program and it was good, real good. Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. 

A second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window. Even off-putting at times, a grouchy Greek chef may signifies a chef of standards. Now only if they can find a bigger place to host their restaurants.","Text1: While Han in Olde City is an eccentric, bossy, know-it-all kinda host.

0,"The food was very tasty but spicy.  I'm not really a fan of Indian food so I'm not a great judge of this stuff but I think it was pretty good.  Very well done, but unbearably spicy.  The only items not spicy were the white rice, pita bread, and vegetable pakora.

Aside from the food, the people were very friendly.  And the lunch buffet was $8.99 which was fair.  My main complaint is the state of the restaurant. The interior is outdated and dark and the exterior is shady, but the atmosphere is comfortable.","We stopped in to Honeygrow for a healthy dinner after running some errands. I loved the ease of ordering my stir-fry through the kiosk and only waited 8 minutes for the stir-fry to be made. I recommend the cherry bbq sauce, it was yummy.  The salads and smoothies looked delicious as well.

Everything was fresh and the portion size was just perfect.  The meal was $8.50 but I am used to paying these types of prices in the city so I didn't find it too unreasonable.

The decor is pretty cool and minimal which goes with the overall healthy, local, organic feel of the place.

They also have iPads on the wall where you can surf the internet, check your mail, etc.

1,"The schermerhorn is really special.

We were able to attend the silent Halloween movie night this past October 31st, and it was my first time there. In a 3 words: classy, elegant and simple. 

This symphony hall offers all sorts of music and performances for all different prices and people. They have drinks which you can (for certain performances) take in to the actual hall itself, in plastic cups of course. The have nice clean bathrooms, an organized coat check and very friendly staff.

I can't wait to come back to this venue!","We have some very expensive kitties...let me tell you. Not even a few months after our little girl cat got an eye infection we found her brother with one helluva of a fever sitting in pain in his own urine in our spare bedroom. Koufax had been to the value vet on main street but they had no openings, so we were referred to this location. Although all of Koufaxs tests came back without anything serious, the vet determined that it was something to do with his liver based on his blood tests. Either way he was given antibiotics and told to sleep on an ice pack and injected with fluids.

Now that last part, injected with fluids is the only reason I'm knocking them off a star. I liked the vet that we dealt with at this location, but just like the other value vet location, there was no clear explanation of what they meant by 'giving him fluids'. Apparently, they administer fluids to a cat by injecting it directly in to a layer of the skin so it creates a hump. LITERALLY Koufax was brought back out with a giant hump. It was shocking to say the least. Upon explanation after the near heart attack we had, they told us that cats absorb the fluids over time through their skin, so they don't have to be hooked up to an IV. I wish they had given us some warning because it was scary.

Koufax is better now. In fact he's actually grown since he's completely healthy which makes me wonder how long he was actually fighting the infection. Anyway, when ever you're at a vet I suggest asking, no demanding a lot of explanation.","Text1: The schermerhorn is really special.

1,"The Blue Duck describes itself as a relaxed tavern featuring classic and new American eats. OK, I can go with that. I stopped in on a Tuesday night to the new Maplewood location with my father and stepmother. We got there right around six and we were the only table but after a couple of minutes it started filling up. Thank goodness because I have a thing about being the only table in a restaurant. I never want to eat somewhere that no one else wants to eat but we were OK here. Our server was friendly and pleasant but not that well versed on the menu. My father was asking about the Chow Chow side and she was trying to describe the flavor to him and I blurted out that it's pickled vegetables and she said oh yes, pickled is correct, they're pickled. So we ordered the Falafel Balls (harrissa tahini, smoked green tomato jam, cilantro, grilled flatbread) appetizer for the table. The grind of the chickpeas was too fine and the falafel had little flavor. The pita bread had a nice char but was very thick and cut in tiny triangles. The harrissa tahini turned out to be incredibly spicy and we are a family that likes heat. My father ate so much of the sauce he was sucking on ice cubes to relieve the heat. He was worried he wasn't going to be able to eat his entree. He ordered the DLT, a duck sandwich, and subbed the side for a small salad. The salad was tiny and no big deal but the sandwich he really liked. He commented on how moist and flavorful the duck was. My stepmother ordered the Seared Trout. This dish was beautifully presented and quite good. There was a tower of fried brussels sprouts on top and a squash puree under the fish. It was all excellent. As soon as I read the Pastrami and Pimiento sandwich I knew I had to order that. I love pastrami and I love pimiento cheese. I got the Mac N Cheese side which was just fair. The sandwich was delicious. I was only able to eat half of it. It was messy but good. I'd order it again and again. They ordered the cookie plate for dessert but I couldn't eat any. I was too full. The macarons looked delicious. Maybe next time.",What's to say about Ted Drewes? It's delicious. I like the Cindermint concrete and the Johnny Rabbit concrete.

1,"My wife and I attended the Wiregrass Symphony of Lights! event to kick off the Christmas Season, and it was wonderful!  There were plenty of people attending the show on Saturday evening, but parking was no problem, and we never felt crowded at all.

The evening was very well organized and had lots of fun things for kids of all ages.  There were jugglers, magician, stilt-walkers and holiday characters, plus balloon artists and face painters.

A talented 20-piece orchestra played Christmas standards and holiday songs with a singer leading the charge.  A perfected outfitted Santa (he may have been the real one!!) was lifted 30 feet in the air on a scissors jack wrapped like a chimney, as the huge main tree and other 'supporting' trees were beautifully lit.  To top off the fun, a fireworks show ended the evening as snowblowers tossed their crystals onto the heads of the audience. 
 
It was truly a fun evening capped by so many smiles on the faces of all that attended.","I've got to give it to Red Robin: they always keep things moving to keep ahead of the competition, and do a very good job of it. They obviously drill their customer service ethic on to their staff, and it's noticeable. It's nice to have a sea of smiles and energy during a visit, and the Servers show an interest in your meal and your satisfaction. Our Server, Drew, did a great job today.

My wife enjoyed her Bonzai Burger (grilled pineapple and swiss cheese), and my Genisys Burger (avacodo, fried jalepenos and bacon) was nice and big and spicy. The fries are always great, and so are the onion rings.

They are running a campaign that donates to the Children's Cancer Fund if you order their Lemonade, which is so thoughtful and easy (and tasty!)

We weren't very hungry but had to get a pizza here. 
I had high hope about this pizzeria since I just had amazing experience at Vetri. How good would be! And Philly does have great pizza overall, this one might be too good to me to handle.

Got rotolo and margarita pizza. Both were very decent food. I just wouldn't wait for that or walk all the way to restaurant from my neighborhood.

Got rotolo and margarita pizza. Both were very decent food. I just wouldn't wait for that or walk all the way to restaurant from my neighborhood. Pretty far to walk from center city..",yes

French toast is my nephew all time favorite and he insists I mention often. I enjoy that regardless the hour of day I can order breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Western Omelette is one of my hubands favorites. Wish they would offer fresh pancake toppings rather than the canned pie filling toppings but it appears to be popular and my husband has no problem with it.","Conveniently located across from Busch Gardens, this fast food Mediterranean restaurant serves some yummy falafel Sammie's!  Made fresh so you can customize. Comes with hummus if you like and Mediterranean style pickles. 

Also got a Greek salad that I saved for later consumption. Kareem is a jokester and kept me laughing while taking order. 

They serve up all kinds of chicken and shawarma type dishes as well.","Text1: We are regulars and rarely have any complaints with this Flap Jacks. Service is good, food is hot and they work around your food allergies or preferences. Prices are reasonable and seating for large groups.

1,"In a word, underwhelming.  I wanted oysters and we had the Gulf $1.00 each ones, they were large and minimally salty, very tasty and a bargain.  I also cracked my tooth on what looked like a pearl.  Tried the calamari with chilli in our ongoing quest for the perfect calamari...it was OK, their own take on calamari, crisp and dry with a smattering of cayenne.  Washed it all down with French 75' cocktail, no need to proceed with entrees, Pablo thought the service was irritating, not sure why.","Pros: Nice urban decor
Cons: Average food,-lamb burger would have been ok but the dijon just did not work on burger it (and I'm sorry but who eats boursin and in public), works better on roasts- poor careless service - waiter could not identify our food when he brought it out which meant much swappery of plates,  careless management - manager meeting  on adjacent table while we tried to indicate to any waiter that would catch our eye that our glasses were empty, they saw us looking and ignored it, oh well you probably lost $50 worth of wine doing that., manager also made a few crass comments when we queried a couple of things, parking is limited, noise level at night beyond belief; 
Cant really think of anything particularly nice to say, at these prices food and service needs to be more sophisticated.
From the outside while waiting for a table, I timed two waitresses taking 18 minutes to set two of those bench tables..knew then there would be issues and should have walked away.    

It will get better and will appeal to a whole bunch of peeps without us, I have a picky NY princess friend who loves this place and ate twice on the same day this week.","Text1: In a word, underwhelming.

1,"A food truck, it has amazing breakfast rolls. Salt peppa ketcha always asked and a giant size - cheap, too, and always fast.  

If you ask for extra mushrooms, they will always put it on properly.  Bacon, ham, and sausage with cheese.. yum! Or extra mushroom & onion cheesesteak.

Eaten at them since 1998, and always go back when I'm close.","I have to say, I saw this before the renovation, and I still like the new one but not as much as the old layout.

I remember subsisting on the chicken sandwiches here for a week when the food carts were mysteriously absent from campus for a bit in one summer. And the 24-7 store also was my favorite place to pick up some Wawa Peach or Green Iced Tea in the half-gallon size.

You have touch-screens now to make your food.

Oh, the hot dogs - only so-so. The make-your-own slushie, very good.

The fruit salad and breakfast foods never really appealed to me, but the pretzels were cheap in the morning.

A place to grab a quick bite to eat. And some other random supplies for college students.","Text1: A food truck, it has amazing breakfast rolls. Salt peppa ketcha always asked and a giant size - cheap, too, and always fast.

That said, we have had some amazing unique drinks and appetizers when meeting with friends at this pub.  It's a great place for those from the suburb to meet those from the city because it's right in the train station.  

It's a bit pricey, but the staff is friendly and as I said the drinks and the food are worth it.","We ordered take out from here the other night.

1,"I used to come to this place years and years ago when it was a dive bar that played Soulja Boy every single time you set foot in that place. I swear, that dude was that place's mascot. Anyway, Evangeline II is A LOT better than that.

Evangeline has a nice cozy feel to it, and although it's small, it still has an area for a band to perform. The night we came there was a pretty cool cover band on stage.

1,"Incredible lunch, that totally blew my New Years diet and I am totally fine with that.  After lunch today, we can not wait to go back and experience their dinner menu. Pan D'olive may well be on its way to being a favorite. 

After receiving our ice tea, a basket of fresh house made breads and olive oil was served. The baguette was great, but the olive bread was the star of the basket. I'd love to know how Sam makes it, it is that good. The olive oil was very light, making it a perfect accent to the olive bread. 

We then ordered two small plates; Calamari and Mussels. The Calamari was the best I have had in the metro area. So many other restaurants over cook Calamari, leaving to dried out and tough chew. Here it was done to perfection, it was tender and an easy chew.  We also shared an order of Mussels. Yippee, I have another addition to my, ""I Want Mussels"" list. I could not resist the garlic, tomato, clam jus. The extra slices of baguette came in handy for soaking up the broth.

Our two lunch entrees were true Mediterranean fare. I had the Grilled Salmon with lemon and capers with a side of sautéed spinach that would have made Popeye happy. The SO enjoyed the Trout which was Walnut Encrusted and also served with that amazing spinach that makes Popeye a strong man. I am not a fan of walnuts, but it added an incredible flavor to this trout. It almost made me nutty for this trout. 

We were filled after our small plates, but pushed on and still enjoyed our entrees. Being truly filled after the entrees, we knew we couldn't stop. Being true Yelpers, it was our duty to try a dessert so our review of a new establishment was complete.  I wanted Creme Brûlée, but the SO is over Creme Brûlée, so we went with the Hazelnut Tiramisu. Once again I am not a fan of nuts on my food, but I liked it. Normally I find Tiramisu to be too sweet, but not here. It had just the right amount of sweetness. Next time, I'm getting the Creme Brûlée and enjoy it all by myself. 

When I go back, I'm trying the Lamb Sliders.","If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix. 
You'll have three tacos; a chorizo, a carnitas, and a mixed-vegetable, along with rice and beans. As usual you'll get the flavorful house salad and a glass of iced tea. ( I love their salad dressing, wish it was available bottled.)
Now let's talk about the new blue plate itself. I'd be hard pressed to select which taco I thought was best, each was in a class of it's own.  I was surprised that I actually liked the vegetable taco. The broccoli had a crisp snap and the red pepper and onion added extra flavor.
The beans were just okay, need something to give it  a bang. Ask for their hot sauce, add it to the rice and you've got a great side to your tacos.

I ordered 1 vegetable tom kha and 1 chicken tom kha.  They sent 2 chicken.. so I had no soup.  

My husband got the singapore noodles and enjoyed them.  

I got the massaman curry with tofu... and it was a giant tub of soup... with a few vegetables floating around in it.  I'm used to significantly more vegetables and tofu... more like a stew consistency.  That being said, if it were good, that would have been doable.  It was so saccharine sweet that I threw the whole thing away, had a few bites of rice, then just went to bed.  It was a total bummer of a meal... sorta ruined my night.

I was pleased that we sat right down though.... and that nobody chased force fed us our food, and chased us out of our booth.  We got to enjoy a full football game at a table, which had never happened to me at Chickies before.  We grazed, and ate good food and watched great football.

The cheesesteak burrito had, you guessed it, cheesesteak. Though, not what you'd typically expect. The pieces were thicker. It was the meat in a unauthentic rendition of a cheesesteak in Old City or some far off city: terrible in something passable for a good cheesesteak but pretty good in a dish clearly attempting to break away from the namesake.","Text1: (5) ~ Excellent Overall Food & Service

 Text2: Had a really good ""Cheesesteak Gringo Burrito"" a week or two ago. Though, I still am not compelled to truly embrase this place. Also had a Spiced Mexican Sangria. Both were quite atypical, creative and pretty good.

The cheesesteak burrito had, you guessed it, cheesesteak. Though, not what you'd typically expect. The pieces were thicker. It was the meat in a unauthentic rendition of a cheesesteak in Old City or some far off city: terrible in something passable for a good cheesesteak but pretty good in a dish clearly attempting to break away from the namesake.",no
1,"It is hard to find a new  establishment who consistently delivers not only a tasty product but a unique and friendly experience. Strange Donuts does it all EACH and EVERY time. I tested this theory with multiple visits over the past few months. I wanted to be very sure... also I like donuts. 

I was one of those loyal social media followers who stalked Strange Donuts months ahead of the opening and even attended a few of the preview events. Strange Donuts is the shining example of new small business and I can only hope they are around for a very long time. 

Now to the donuts!! Strange offers up classics, creations and strangers. While I haven't managed to make it to the late night showings of the strangers, the concept of chef collaborations for specialty donuts makes me swoon. Classics are tasty and always fresh. The creations is where Strange finds its calling though. You can tell in the taste and presentation that each donut was carefully crafted.My personal favorite is the campfire, a glorious chocolate cake donut dusted with graham crackers crumbs and topped with a toasted marshmellow. Oh and try the mexican hot chocolate. They kicked up the heat on this little wonder. It's amazing.

In summary: Go eat donuts, enjoy the friendly goofy staff and support this local business so they can be a fixture in Maplewood for years to come.","Another one of those places which has been on my list of St. Louis eateries since I moved here over a year ago. I'm not depressed it took me this long to go. 

I somehow managed to avoid the crazy lunch time crowd everyone warns against. Maybe Mondays at 11:15 is the secret down time? Even though the restaurant was full there was no line and I was in and out with my lunch in less than ten minutes. Great service and friendly waitstaff. 

I ordered the Chicken Shack Ranch because I feel like bacon, cheese and ranch are where a person should always start. Man it was good. Like so good I have already planned to come back and order it again the following day good. I've also started a list of other sandwiches I want to try. No doubt each sandwich will be better than the next. Anyone want to come with me? I feel like this should be a group effort. 

Take a break from that semi local chain (cough Panera) and eat at a real local place who is doing it right.","Text1: It is hard to find a new  establishment who consistently delivers not only a tasty product but a unique and friendly experience.

I was surprised to find sugared cashews in my shrimp dish, which really did much to up the taste, but overall the whole thing was............um  tasteless.","I came here on Halloween with some friends and upon arrival we were greeted by a female security guard who was very polite. She was managing the door very quickly, keeping the line moving. There's literally only one door to enter and exit so I felt like she was conducting traffic lol. Entry fee was $10 per person... a bit high but whatever. The bar top itself wasn't that busy. Everyone had drinks in their hands and maybe one or two people were waiting for their drink. The female bartender who was dressed up like a mermaid (I think that's what she was lol) was rude. She didn't acknowledge me whatsoever. She could have said, ""Hi! I'll be with you shortly."" Or just a hello in general. Finally, after waiting almost 10 minutes I ordered my drink. I didn't bother to order another because I didn't want to spend my entire night waiting at the bar.","Text1: This place used to be so much better, but after the 2nd time eating here within the year I am just giving it 2 stars.

0,"I am super impressed. Lots of food, reasonable prices, wonderful friendly service. The atmosphere is rustic modern with a great open kitchen. I had the pollo 1/4 chicken which was for me so big I could barely finish. They even gave me extra tortillas when I ran out, didn't even have to ask. Now that's service. Also had queue fundido, which was excellent appetizer. If I were to do it again I'd probably go with a more veggie type appetizer. My meal and appy had a lot of breads accompanying it, but I enjoyed the food here. The flavor is juicy and tender! Very impressed!

I don't think I've had better service at a  restaurant. The waitress was spot on and almost anticipated my needs. Felt like me had a Vulcan mind meld! Five stars easily, liked the prices and portions here as well!","From the outside, and at first glance inside, this looked like it wasn't going to be much.  Hole-in-the-wall-ish from outside, and inside the one steam-table shut down, dimly lit with old decor, standard-looking red-green menu, backlit pictures behind the counter, and grandma baby-sitting two of the owners' small kids in the dining area.

I was pleasantly surprised to find at least three Thai dishes on the dinner-combo menu, so I ordered the Pad Thai.  The rest of the menu looked pretty standard. Though they do have fried chicken wings and buffalo wings in the appetizers section, and 5 kinds of duck under the ""Thai and Fusion Cuisins""(sic).

The young 20-something lady behind the counter spoke with a heavy Chinese accent, but she both understood and communicated very well. She wrote up my order and ran my credit card while taking another order over the phone like an old pro, and kitchen staff were bringing delivery and to-go orders up to the counter.

There was a constant stream of to-go orders, people calling in, and people picking up. This is one popular place! And when a few orders were ready to be run out, one of the guys from the kitchen took them out for delivery. 

Buffet, $3.99, is for lunch only, but you can also order off the menu for lunch.

To-go/delivery are served in standard clam-shells and pint/quart paper containers.  Minimum $10 for delivery in limited area. Dine-in meals are served on a solid plate with stainless steel utensils.  Soft drinks are from a soda machine behind the counter, served in a plastic tumbler, but the cashier regularly checked to see if I wanted a refill.

My Pad Thai came with both shrimp and chicken.  I liked it.  Not the best I've had, but pretty darn good. Especially considering the staff is not Thai.

Fax # is 780-8383.

Located in between K-Mart and Marsh.

Open later than most.  Hours: Mon-Thur: 10:30am - 10pm. Fri/Sat: 10:30am - 11pm. Sun: Noon - 10pm.

0,"Let me set the scene for you:

10pm-ish on a Wednesday night. Me and about 15 other drunk, sweaty runners just finished up a kickass 5 mile jaunt around South City. Yep, you read that right. I'm a drinker with a running problem. Don't ask any questions. 

Anyway, we weren't ready to end the party, so we hit up Barney's for more drinks and some food. 

Barney's is a hole in the wall dive in South City. On this particular night, it was pretty dead. Well, it WAS, until we came and stank up the place. The bartenders were super nice and friendly and didn't bat an eye at our ridiculousness. They kept the drinks flowing, and the food came out pretty quickly. 

The food itself? Not bad! I nibbled on some mozzarella sticks and had some thin crust pizza that had bacon, jalapenos, and what I'm 99% sure was provel. And it wasn't half bad!

One thing to note: if you start a tab, there's a $10 minimum that you must spend before you can close it out. Just something to keep in mind. 

Would I come here sober? Probably not. But on this particular night, Barney's was just what we all needed.","To be fair, I haven't gone to a major league baseball game since I was in kindergarden.  Still, I had a great time for the price paid!  I really felt as though I was taken care of here and the food, although super expensive, was alright.  

I was really impressed at how nice this place is.","Text1: Let me set the scene for you:

1,"I really enjoyed Sophie's Nails! I think its a great little place on the south side that is extremely affordable and they do a great job! I got my toes done before I left for San Fran and they painted them bright pink! The nail polish has lasted without a chip or dent. They were quick to do the pedicure and they did a really good job. I also enjoyed the massage chairs they had, I probably could have sat in them all day! They also managed to squeeze me in for an eyebrow waxing at the last minute and both spa treatments ended up costing me $45 with tax and tip. A great del if you ask me! They also offer gel schalack nails, which I'm hoping to try in the near future!","Unfortunately this Holt isn't great. Calgary's Holt Renfrew has so much more to offer, it's bigger, better designers and over all just seems to be of a higher quality. The clothing is priced highly, as it is with designers, but the designers aren't something to lust over. There is an average selection of shoes and a fairly decent selections of handbags. I've heard rumours that the Tiffany's within Holt is closing/has closed so that is really sad =(. Holt's saving grace is the Louis Vuitton inside of it. While I find the Holt employees to be a bit snobby the LV employees are not! They always welcome me and encourage me to try things on even though it's sometimes daunting in stores that come with high price tags. I like to wander aimlessly through Holt browsing through designers. It's a leisurly activitiy.","Text1: I really enjoyed Sophie's Nails!

1,"The first thing you'll notice when you walk into the restaurant is how tiny the space is. There are 30 seats in the restaurant and an additional 12 at the bar, but the seating is creatively arranged to allow guests and servers to move through the restaurant with ease. The decor is an odd juxtaposition of rustic meets modern. You notice the variety of whiskey bottles on the shelves behind the bar and immediately acknowledge that you're in a Southern-style restaurant. Service moves at a slow, steady pace. The first of our dishes arrives, a bed of mustard greens tossed with benne seeds and peanuts. The dressing is fiery hot and spicy good! Spicy without being unbearable, the dressing accents the nuts and greens nicely. What a crazy flavor combination! The shrimp and grits were utter perfection. Big, juicy, grilled shrimp sitting on top of a small helping of creamy, buttery grits with diced pieces of country ham strewn for good measure. Who would think grits could be this good? The buttermilk coated fried oyster slider with its burst of flavor in the middle was just sooo good! Move over crabcake and filet sliders, this oyster slider has found a place in my heart! The blackened catfish was one of the best pieces of catfish I've ever eaten. It was firm like rockfish, but didn't have that characteristic catfish taste or odor. The Carolina gold rice is one of the best accompaniments I've ordered in a while. It pairs really well with the hot chicken, which is OH. MY. GOD. everything that the hype says it is. It is indeed fiery hot, as in spicy hot. It is indeed crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. My friend Chris W and I were ready, willing, and able to dive right into the alleged chicken that saw fit to win the heart of local food critic, Craig Laban. In our two orders, our server stated how fortunate we were to have one dish with white meat and one dish with dark meat. Without hesitation, I went for the dark meat. I tasted a small sample of the breast meat on Chris's plate and it, too, was juicy good. Almost too good. Was there crack in the chicken? The pecan pie was a delicious ending to a fantastic meal. You can't ask for a better meal anywhere. I felt like I was at Morimoto or Vetri. For this reason, I can honestly give The Fat Ham my highest rating.","In my recent Panera review, I say, ""Oh, and if I want something that's a thousand times better than a bear claw, I will go to Swiss Haus Bakery in Center City where they have a delicious almond croissant filled with a huge helping of wonderful almond cream.""

I don't like kicking something when it's down, but it was such a crappy cronut and I discovered that the place was closed a week later that I didn't bother writing a scathing review for it. To think that Crumbs started in my hometown, too! Blasphemy. Anyways, Swiss Haus' cronut was the complete opposite. The layers were flaky and soft and the outer part crisped perfection.

My beef is against the deli section and the kid behind the counter who couldn't set the meat slicer to cut ""thick slices of meat"" as I wished. He had a big attitude about it as he continued to cut paper thin slices of meat. I'm not sure it's his fault in this. Someone probably should've taught him how to configure the meat slicer. There were two other people behind the counter he could've consulted if he needed help. Even the little deli near me with the foreign immigrants running it know how to cut thick slices of deli meat with their meat slicers.","Text1: In my recent Panera review, I say, ""Oh, and if I want something that's a thousand times better than a bear claw, I will go to Swiss Haus Bakery in Center City where they have a delicious almond croissant filled with a huge helping of wonderful almond cream.""

I love the powdered cinnamon and the small amount of vanilla cream on top. Mine could've used a little more custard filling, but what custard I got was a perfect complement to the layers. The entire $5 experience of a Swiss Haus cronut was basically lunch for me. It's a very filling pastry! Try it, try it, try it. You must. Maybe a suggestion for future cronuts... a raspberry filling... mmmm!!!! 

 Text2: As far as supermarkets go, I don't expect much. I like my name brand things sprinkled with a few higher quality options. The produce section boasted three different kinds of tomatoes and for a low- to mid-end store to provide some really nice beefsteak tomatoes, the kind that are so large I can't use my tomato cutter on them, is really awesome. My beef is against the deli section and the kid behind the counter who couldn't set the meat slicer to cut ""thick slices of meat"" as I wished. He had a big attitude about it as he continued to cut paper thin slices of meat. I'm not sure it's his fault in this. Someone probably should've taught him how to configure the meat slicer. There were two other people behind the counter he could've consulted if he needed help. Even the little deli near me with the foreign immigrants running it know how to cut thick slices of deli meat with their meat slicers.",yes
0,We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday.  We order meat pelmeni and veggie pelmeni.  These are a Russian version of tortellini.  Both versions were excellent.,"I've been on the tour 5 times now. Even if you're a craft beer connoisseur and are ""Anti AB/Inbev"" this tour is still awesome. The history behind Anheuser Busch is cool to learn about, especially what the brewery did during prohibition. There's no reason not to take this tour, it's free, interesting, and you get two free beer at the end. In the gift shop you can mix and match your own 6-pk which is fun. And dont forget to check in on yelp!","Text1: We stopped here for lunch on a Saturday.  We order meat pelmeni and veggie pelmeni.  These are a Russian version of tortellini.

1,"The Shop of Wiregrass Mall offer shopping, dining, exercising, kid club, community for the people of Wesley Chapel and New Tampa. I have been there many time and enjoy every time. They have Kid area for the activity. It is great to walk at the mall by the window shopping.


This mall is very lively due to farmer market, Christmas event, spring fair, and now the Easter event. This mall has line up event to keep it sales up. You won't believe they have Yoga at the lawn, Kid Club and many other event. Please check their web site. They also have stage area for the performance and gather the community together. 

The restaurant selection also very good. I know most of my friend go there for evening walk or dog walk. They also have the bookstore with coffee and music store with lesson. If you asking for activities, they have ton of it. One thing I like the most is their paseo drive. It is almost like the Rodeo Drive. Although not fancy but very pleasant.","The gimmick sushi. I have been conveyor belt or rotation sushi in Miami 10 year ago. Now Tampa got their first rotation sushi. The seat booths are well decorated. This method is already popular in Japan. I saw quite a few when I visited Hokkaido. 

This type of food stand supposed to provide quick sushi for short lunch time or snack with no wait. Tonight we came in late at 8:30 pm. I would said come in at weekday not weekend and late or early of meal time is better. One- don't have many people. Two-easy attention from waiter. Three-most important is order the fresh items that is not there and fresh to eat. Since the time we arrive is late, the chef start not adding dish in the conveyor belt. This actually better for me that I can order the fresh items. I would suggest the same thing if you want to try this place. 

We have order the spicy tuna, blossom roll, spicy pepper calamari, masago. I like their spicy tuna since it is all tuna meat in the roll, no added cucumber to occupy the meat space.","Text1: The Shop of Wiregrass Mall offer shopping, dining, exercising, kid club, community for the people of Wesley Chapel and New Tampa.

1,"Buena Onda delivered to my expectations! Great tacos, especially the fried Atlantic Mahi Mahi (add a hit of hot sauce!) and Carnitas (adore Garces's pineapple and jícama slaw) and nachos (baked to the point at which some of the chips were very brown/crisped and the cheese crunchy, which some dinner mates adored). Loved the casual ambience and, as many have said, the free beer while in line made the wait bearable. Will definitely return when the craving for tacos hits!","Great burger. No, really. Kinda want one right now just thinking about it. It's not cooked to order, but both of the two patties were spot-on medium from edge to center, very juicy, and the flavor seriously rivals Good Dog's. The thin-cut fries were also well-seasoned and crisp.

The deviled eggs were good: topped with some sort of pickled something, which isn't what I expect on a regular deviled egg, but was refreshing/interesting. I also grudgingly tried the octopus, which I usually find too rubbery to get past the texture to the flavor. This octopus wasn't rubbery at all!, which allowed me to realize that I'm just not a huge octopus fan flavor-wise. The sauce with peppers and sausage that went with the octopus was great--great depth of flavor--could really taste the peppers, and the sausage, and the tomato base each separately and all together as layers!","Text1: Buena Onda delivered to my expectations!

There seems to be a lot of experimentation here. The coconut beer was one of my favorite. Also the imperial cream ale, I don't think I've seen imperial cream before.

All-you-can-eat mussels on Sunday.  Sounds like a good deal.  If you stick with a bowl or two, they are extremely tasty and well done.  However, bowl number three always reminds me  to quite while I'm a head.

For a place with decent food and solid specials, she alone has managed to keep me from frequenting there more often.","I know, I know, it's a chain.

1,"At first I was not pleased with my dining selection.  The bar was LOUD for like 5 patrons.  They seated my on the restaurant side which was much quieter although still loud.  The server was great!  

I had the pretzel bites which were incredible they matched well with the cheese sauce.  

The server told me that the cheeseburger was voted best in St louis.  It was great.  It was overcooked.  I ordered medium rare, it came out med well.  Part of reason for four stars.  

They homemade chips were very good, but they would benefit from 20 sec in the microwave. 

It was expensive.  The bill for food alone was over $20.  Thus is the other reason for 4 stars.  Burger, chips, and a half a pretzel????

The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   

The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   

Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  

Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!

Honestly, I couldn't remember the last time I had Papa Johns before today (I'm definitely a Dominos junkie!). I ordered online and drove about 20 minutes before going in. My pizza was still in the oven for a couple minutes; no problem.

I get my pepperoni pizza and leave. Personally I was not a fan of this pizza. The sauce is almost too sweet and then it has like a pepper taste that doesn't work well with it. The only part of the pizza I liked was the crust. It was very light and fluffy. 

Personally, I'll stick with Dominos.","Food is good! We order 2 time a week, since we live right behind it.

Honestly, I couldn't remember the last time I had Papa Johns before today (I'm definitely a Dominos junkie!). I ordered online and drove about 20 minutes before going in. My pizza was still in the oven for a couple minutes; no problem.

I get my pepperoni pizza and leave. Personally I was not a fan of this pizza. The sauce is almost too sweet and then it has like a pepper taste that doesn't work well with it. The only part of the pizza I liked was the crust. It was very light and fluffy. 

Personally, I'll stick with Dominos. 

 Text2: Food is good! We order 2 time a week, since we live right behind it. We call in our order, which is always a challenge, because they kid takes forever to write the order down. The food is VERY inconsistent. It could be  great one time and then it sucks the next time.

1,"This place was seriously delicious! My boyfriend and I decided to come here to celebrate after I took a big exam and it was well worth it. 

We got there around 2 after a horrible time at the DMV and were warmly greeted by the host, who sat us almost immediately. Once we sat down we both already knew what we wanted: a burger with all the trimmings, and top it with some onions, cheddar and bacon please! We also ordered the duck fat fries with the cheese sauce.

After placing our orders our waiter quickly brought us our drinks: I got the philadelphia punch which was apricot brandy and tea,, with some other delightful ingredients. And my boyfriend got an old fashioned. His was a lot stronger than mine by definition, but I was so pleased with both of our drinks. Mine was sweet but not overwhelming, and his was tart and smacks you in the face with some liqour. Exactly what we both wanted.

Once our burgers came we both dove right in. You have to flatten your burger cause it's such a fat patty. I stupidly ate the bread first and saved the burger for last cause in my mine, I'm thinking, ""save the best for last!"" But I was so full I had a couple bites left of delicious meat on my plate. Burgers were juicy and the carmelized onions were sweet and a perfect compliment to the bacon. 

The duck fat fries with the cheese sauce were also perfect! Just the right amount of salt and thickness to the fries, and the cheese sauce was like magic.

Little known tip for the future customer: eat the bread side last, and make sure you have plenty of napkins. You'll be having burger juice run down your chin and not feel bad about it.","Damn this place is good! went for a quick lunch with a friend last weekend and I loved how cheap this place was, the table salsas, and the free beer while you wait.

I tried the grilled shrimp and grilled mahi and both were amazing. Small portions, but you get a slice of avocado and some red cabbage coleslaw on top. Top it off with some of that red, hot salsa that they put on the table and you're in heaven. You can taste the freshness in the fish, and the tequila glazed shrimp is absolutely amazing! Everything was very fresh (I could tell it was fresh cause a fish truck was pulling in the back as I got in line) and flavorful without being overdone. The toasted flour tortilla was a nice touch as well!

Will absolutely be coming back! Did not get to try the margaritas, and am a bit skeptical when I look at the prices, but I hear they're strong so I don't mind :)","Text1: This place was seriously delicious!

1,"One of the better mexican places in NOLA, although it really is Tex-Mex, and not at all authentic. Great place to go for happy hour and have some cerveza or magaritas. Great menu selection. Great location. Great fun.","The sales portion of the store is full of nice clothing with sales associates tending to you as if they are waiters at Antoine's, but everything is certainly overpriced. The rental portion of the store though is abyssmal.

1,"Let's get one thing out of the way at the beginning.  I know next to nothing about Arnold Myint.  I mean I am aware that he is a hometown kid gone big time on TV, but that is about the extent of it.  I have never seen top cook or been to any of his other restaurants.  Heck he might have been the person who prepared my food during my visit to am@fm.  He kind of looked like the guy on the poster, but that is a glamour shot so who knows.  All of this is to say that I had no preconceived notions of what am@fm would be or what to expect.  

I went during the farmers market lunch rush and sat at the counter instead of going the carry-out  route.  The counter space and the additional seating are both a significant step up from the normal farmers market environment.  Real silverware, clothe napkins, wine glasses for water, you get the picture.  

I ordered the counter special which was a crostini plate with four different types of crostini.  This was not a pre-prepared dish, it was acually made to order by maybe-Arnold-Myint on the spot.  While it was being prepared I was given a small bowl of the house made potato chips which were excellent.  The crostini arrived and between the four of them they offered what almost amounted to a full course meal.  There was the heirloom tomato and basil crostini (salad), the artichoke goat cheese crostini (app), the dill egg salad crostini (main), and the ricotta peach and honey crostini (dessert).  They were all excellent and actually filled me up far more than I expected going in.  To top it off I got a small slice of brownie and some blueberries as a bonus.  All in all it was a completely satisfying meal and a complete surprise in the farmers market.  

For all of this I paid a whopping $8, a fantastic deal and what you would pay for a combo set at almost any other restaurant for lunch. 
I don't know if the counter special will be a daily feature or if I just lucked out on the day I went.  The sandwiches and salads also offered a lot of variety and were very reasonably priced.  You could get a half sandwich (3.75) and a side salad (2.25) for 6 bucks and have a pretty awesome light lunch.   I also saw a couple of customers who just went with a sampling of 3 salads and they seemed to be very pleased.  

So value + quality + nice setting = a very satisfied customer  

Overall, I think that am@fm is an outstanding addition to the farmers market and to Nashville dining as a whole.  They have fresh creative food at very reasonable prices.  I know that I am already planning multiple visits back to see what else they will offer.  

I went to am@fm with a clean slate, I left nothing but a clean plate.","You gotta love a place that stakes it's reputation on Grits.  The rotating selection of grits and side dishes is what really sets B&C apart from other barbecue joints in town.  Taco grits, buffalo grits, cheddar garlic grits and even chocolate grits.  They are takin the grits uptown in the downtown farmer's market.

The barbecue is good, but good barbecue is not to hard to come by in this town if you know where to look.  The reason to make a trip to the farmers market is for the specialty grits, corn salad, smoked hamburgers, smoked salmon and all the other creative things that B&C does.","Text1: Let's get one thing out of the way at the beginning.

I came here a few times years ago to see a stylist i liked and it felt so ""old lady-esq"" that I stopped coming, my stylist left and of course they won't tell you where they went. The only remaining stylist from the prior ownership is Chris and she's such a great asset to this salon. So now I have Kate's # so now she's mine forever lol

Recently I was gifted for my birthday to get a keratin treatment on my hair and after calling around local shops I settled on 9 West Main and boy oh boy am I glad I did. 

My stylist, Kate, is awesome. Super friendly, social and welcoming. Today was my second keratin treatment, takes 2 hours but is so so worth it! I also get my roots covered every month-6 weeks and it's so affordable I don't have to suffer with gray roots for 2 months like I used to. My average based on my hair growth is every 5 weeks. Keratin every 3 months. 

They do both mens and womens cuts here. It's always to best make an appointment here but they service walk-ins as well. I can't say anything more than they are spectacular. Give them a try!

Cut and color = $85
Keratin = $150

The salon i used prior was $120 for cut and color.","Amazing! Fantastic BYO.

Came here on a cold, winter night for the first time. So many people have raved about this place, and now I know why. From the moment we sat down, we felt we were like the only ones there. (We clearly were not. The place was absolutely lively with so much happiness around!). The owner introduced himself to us, and helped us decide on what to order. We ordered the  lamb stew, monkfish, this phyllo pie appetizer (forgot the name), and later, a very tasty chocolate and date dessert.

Perhaps it was the flowing wine at every table, but the restaurant was crowded with large parties, family get togethers, and a birthday party. We were in good company. Narrow spaces for the servers to bring us food and water, but they were great in maneuvering around this small restaurant.

I cannot wait to come here again to try their brunch. The experience was a solid one. Large, delicious dishes that were made love. Super friendly owner and servers. Inviting and vibrant atmosphere. Great choice for a date night (first, second,146th), girls night (reunions, catch-up on gossip, talk about boys, share baby pictures), guys night (place for excellent food, talk about girls), birthday parties (BYO, 'nuff said), and any other occasion.

Seriously, a great restaurant to dine and share the experience with your loved ones.","Text1: Love love love Kate!

The emphasis here is more on food, produce, and cafe items (soups, salads, and sandwiches in particular) more than household items, although you can still find hair and skin care, soaps, reusable drinking bottles, and a smaller selection of pretty much everything you can find at the Whyte Avenue location.

I also tried some of the lemon chicken - you can get that on rice or as an ""appetizer,"" which is a small bucket full of fried, lemony goodness. It had a good crunch and wasn't too sweet. 

The place is very bright and clean, with cool, colourful decor and lots of long, wooden benches. It took a while for our order to be made, but everything here is made fresh which accounts for the wait. I can imagine it getting very busy here during the lunch hour. 

Food is served in paper bowls and boxes, even if you're staying. My portion did not seem large for the almost $12, but it was deceptive, with lots of meat and noodles that filled me up as much as in the soup restaurants I frequent.

1,"Such a Beautiful Hotel! I was only in the hotel to meet some friends at the W XYZ Bar, so I unfortunately did not experience the accommodations of their hotel rooms.

I love the modern contemporary look and the wide open snack bar which I was proud of myself that I was able to stay away. 

The only staff member we were greeted by was the valet, but he had no choice since he had to take my car to park it. Overall, he was very friendly. 

Valet Parking for overnight guests is $20 and for non-guests it is $10. However, of you spend $10 at the bar, your parking fee is only $5. You are able to pay for parking at the bar itself, and they will validate your ticket.  

We were never greeted ""Hello"" or ""Goodbye"" by the front desk attendant who seemed to be attending to her cell phone instead.

It hasn't changed too much except now it is a British Pub and there is karaoke...ok maybe two major changes haha. One thing has remained the same, it is still a good time. 

From the friendly bartenders to the stiff drinks, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Flacco made us this fabulous drink called the ""Skinny Blue Bitch"" and it was delicious because it wasn't too sweet or could you taste the alcohol in it!

From the friendly bartenders to the stiff drinks, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Flacco made us this fabulous drink called the ""Skinny Blue Bitch"" and it was delicious because it wasn't too sweet or could you taste the alcohol in it! 

I don't generally bar hop in Ybor too much, but I will definitely be back. Great bar and fun times!",yes
0,"Had a really basic chicken dish.  I feel like I'm 79 years old saying this, but the ""early bird"" special of a piece of chicken and 2 sides for $9 seemed alright. Pretty low price given the zip code.  Added a side Caesar salad for I think $3 more.  The salad was the best part of the meal.  The garlic mashed potatoes were forgettable.  Garlic bread was good.  Chicken was just, eh, a bland piece of chicken.  My friend ordered the grouper sandwich and seemed happy with that and the sweet potato fries (extra charge).","Thank you Trops for not dismissing STL altogether after the last location closed. The grove is the perfect place for you to be and this location is awesome! 

I came here last Saturday with a friend and the place was jumping! Sadly because of the rain, the patio wasn't open, but even still, the place is huge with lots of seating. The variety of slushies here is great, just like the one in COMO. You can also mix the flavors to make your own boozy delight. The prices aren't bad either. The small is $5 and is definitely enough. The service by the barkeeps is also great.

One day soon I'll come back and try the Guerrilla Street Food and enjoy the patio. Can't wait!","Text1: Had a really basic chicken dish.

0,"I really think this is the best wine shop in St. Louis.  I know a lot of people that prefer Starrs, but I just love this place.  

They have a massive assortment of wines in the shop.  Not being a wine connoisseur myself, I have partaken in more than one box of Peter Vella in my day, I always feel a little, well, inferior when I go into wine shops.  Usually, the people that work in them seem so pretentious, and I seem, well, like I drink boxed wine.  This has never happened to me at Grapevine.  The workers are all super friendly and don't make you feel ridiculous for wanting to keep the price tag under $12.  They will even find you a GOOD wine for under $12 if you tell them what it is you want.  

An altogether pleasant wine shopping experience, and it sure beats shopping for wine at Dierberg's.","This is a milestone review for me on Yelp.  I had been struggling with which one to chhose.  I decidede to make it Redemption.  This was seriously one of the best meals of my ENTIRE life.  

This review was from about 2 months ago.  Sorry it is a little dated.  Such as life.  

The setting is an old church.  It is really a beautiful surrounding for a restaurant.  Although I am an old church architecture nerd.  It was really cool to look around.   

The service was incredible.  I was hear as part of a group of 7 other characters, several were part of the NOLA restaurant scene.  We wanted a good time with the meal and they provided it!   

Paneed smoked soft shell crab a la Christian.  I was not fortunate enough to have enjoyed the original.  I can not comment on the faithfulness to the founders recipe.  I can say this there is no highe calling for a soft shell crab than to be cold smoked and fried in preparation for this dish.  On to your 77 virgins and mecca for you!  But I experienced heaven eating this.  

Seafood stuffed filet of fish a la Christian's - This was superlative.  Again did not try the original, but the mirliton and seafood stuffing was heavenly, and more importantly improved the taste of the fresh flounder rather than competing for the spot light!   

The combination was quite possibly one of the 10 best meals of my life.  If you have been here, you should try it!","Text1: I really think this is the best wine shop in St. Louis.  I know a lot of people that prefer Starrs, but I just love this place.

1,I love going to family owned establishments and this is a fine example.  The people are very nice here.  The quality of their product is very high and their prices are commensurate with this.  Expect extremely tasty baked goods that are worth the price.  The variety is also great.  Don't bother with street parking.  There is a great public parking lot across the street.,"Gardening requires a lot of water - most of it in the form of perspiration.  If you want to sweat a little less you buy plants at a quality greenhouse.  True gardeners would rather poke a stick in their eye than buy plants at Home Depot or Lowes.  You may get a good price but you just don't get the quality.

Russell Gardens is a great family owned greenhouse.  Break out your GPS to get there as it's out in the boondocks.  These folks have a split personality.  There is the retail operation and 100 yards down the road with a separate parking lot is the wholesale site.  Why should you care?  Read on.

The retail operation is well run with hundreds of annuals and perennials.  Most of the plants are grown on site.  This is a big deal because your purchases are acclimated to this area and that makes them more likely to survive and thrive.  Prices are completive with other greenhouses.

So what about this wholesale operation?  Wouldn't it be great to get in there and pay wholesale prices?  Savvy gardeners know the secret!  The greater Philly area has dozens and dozens of gardening clubs and societies.   The Russell Gardens folks are smart and allow folks that are members of select clubs to visit the wholesale side and pay wholesale prices.  This is an entirely different world.  It is not as pretty as the retail side as this is where all the plants are grown.  You'll find yourself wandering along row after row of giant greenhouses.  The lovely wife and I visited yesterday as we are members of the Delaware Valley Water Garden Society (DVWGS).  We loaded up on quality plants at great prices.  

So if you are a serious gardener and like a great deal, find a club in your area has this relationship.

1,"I am in love with this store. There are gifts galore, including beautiful jewelry, toys, games, and loads of candy - especially hard to find stuff that is imported from Great Britain. I bought some very cool buttons and some candy. I was also intrigued by the bottles of vintage soda pop. The owner makes candy bouquets as well, so if you want a delicious alternative to flowers for someone who loves candy, this is the place to go.","A downtown location of the popular organic, natural, and fair trade store. The emphasis here is more on food, produce, and cafe items (soups, salads, and sandwiches in particular) more than household items, although you can still find hair and skin care, soaps, reusable drinking bottles, and a smaller selection of pretty much everything you can find at the Whyte Avenue location. What you can get here that you can't get there are fresh, delicious vegetarian and vegan light meals that you can enjoy in the store or take away. I was eyeing some of the sandwiches and dips in particular. There is also a fairly substantial produce section, and refrigerated and frozen food section. The space is bright, clean, and is more hipster than hippy (in contrast to the Whyte Avenue location, which is more hippy), which can be attributed to the trendy 104 Street location. Worth checking out for anyone interested in a sustainable lifestyle.","Text1: I am in love with this store.

1,"Fiiiiiinnnnally got to eat here after everyone wouldn't stop shutting up about how good it is! I will say, it lived up to the hype. I certainly agree with Chef Brooks nomination in Food & Wine mag and all the well-deserved recognition that he (& Milktooth) have received. The options are crazy good (really regret not grabbing one of those beautiful pastries!!), flavors are solid, cappuccino was perfect, decor was perfect, ect. I got the halibut, and potato & celeriac latke: both were fantastic. It wasn't necessarily relaxing because of how packed they were and the crowd waiting by the door, but this didn't ruin the experience... I just prefer a more chill brunch! Can't wait to come back though. Props to everyone working here too!","Honestly had no idea this was here, but came in for a friend's birthday and it was absolutely phenomenal. I mean the polenta.... dear god, it was addicting. Probably the best I've ever had with the chorizo and bleu cheese. The Manchego Crisp salad, Barbacoa empanadas (very filling!), and skirt steak were to die for. This is like many upscale places where you get smaller dishes for a higher price, so I highly recommend sharing like we did! Just an excuse to try more food, honestly. The Sangria was sweet and fresh, I could drink that all day. I LOVED the atmosphere/interior: the dim lighting, the gorgeous dishes used, it was all stunning. A perfect date spot as well, if you're into that. I definitely plan on coming back. Classy, sexy establishment that can give you an immersive experience.","Text1: Fiiiiiinnnnally got to eat here after everyone wouldn't stop shutting up about how good it is!

1,"I wandered into this place one day on my lunch hour, and I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, there 's no one at my work that I can get lunch with, so I tend to stick to take-out places for lunch where I don't feel weird eating alone.  However, I braved my lunchtime solo-ness and got myself a little table in this tiny basement restaurant on Sansom Street because I was curious about how the food was.  

The waiter was very nice and attentive, and I ordered a chicken kabob over rice with an eggplant and pita appetizer.  Everything was delicious, and I think the chicken had saffron on it, a very expensive and tasty spice.  I was able to read my book in peace, and I enjoyed listening to the large and boisterous group of people at a table in the back (up a few steps), who seemed to be enjoying themselves on some sort of business lunch.  I really enjoyed my meal, and it was really pretty cheap, so I would definitely go back again, with friends this time so we can be the boisterous group at the back table.","I went in here the other day, partly because I wanted to kill some time in an air conditioned venue while waiting for someone in Olde City and partly because I have a whole stack of books that I want to get rid of, so I wanted to ask if they buy used books.  However, the owner was deep in conversation with some guy when I went in, so I decided to browse while he was finishing his conversation.  I had the same negative reaction to this place as I did to the Strand in NYC.  Disorganized used book stores turn me off the worst way.  The aisles are tight, stacks of books litter the floors in the aisles, so you can't get down them easily, and it's very, very difficult to find anything because it's so disorganized.  That means you'll have to ask for help, and it's hard to do that when the owner is busy chatting away with his buddy, and there's no one else there to help out.  Plus, this place was freaking hot.  Especially the second floor, where the fiction and some other categories are.  

Anyway, it was hot and I wanted to get out of there, away from the clutter, heat, and moldy/dusty book smell, but I had to wait until I caught the owner's attention to ask him about selling him my books before I could make a break for the door.  Finally, I managed to ask my question, and I was told that they only trade store credit for people's books.  That was disappointing, but I guess they really are just a book trader in the literal sense.  If this was a store that I ever thought I'd set foot in again, then store credit might be okay, but buying books that I need (and I need a lot for my grad program) from this store would be a nightmare.  If they were more organized (and had air conditioning that worked!), I might consider it.  But I think I'll take my business elsewhere.  God, I miss the used book store from South Street that got closed down and replaced with a trendy men's clothing store!

1,"Oh Philly, I miss you and your indifferent baristas. I promised my niece that we'd go out for coffee when I was visiting, and we decided to hit the city. This place is open late on weekends, so we grabbed some cookies and coffee and settled in to talk about college and internships. It wasn't crowded--just a few folks with laptops. 

The space is pretty big, with plenty of room to work or socialize. The coffee is fine. The pastries are fine. And that's really all there is to say.","I hadn't been to a major studio film since I moved to Philly (I used to watch them on DVD when I had netflix and stuck to the Ritz theaters when I went out).  But I wanted to see a certain major studio film on the big screen.  I'd been to the Bridge when I lived in LA, so I was excited to check out the Philly version.  

Like the West Coast Bridge, this theater is stylish, clean and has stadium seating.  You can grab a drink before/after the film, and you get an assigned seat.  Unlike the West Coast, this theater is affordable--this Bridge is much cheaper here.  I LOVED that.

I settled on 3 stars because the theater was about a 4 and the crowd was about a 1.  In the ""media immersion room,"" where you can text your name and see it on a big screen, clever kids send in names like ""cockmaster"" and ""____ is a homo"" and other things about people enjoying sex with animals.  Classy.

In the theater, two young women (apparently about 16--too young for rated R--because they were at a family movie) talked, kicked each other, wrestled, squealed, and watched stuff on their cellphones.  They were in my row and kept running to different seats as they played around.  They got up to leave (loudly) only to come back and start again.  One girl made a phone call.  No hushed voice, no indoor voice, but the voice you use when you are on a cell phone in a wind storm while standing next to a moving train.  ""I'm at a movie.  I'm with _____!  Blah Blah Bah!""

Behind me, kids screamed, cried, kicked my seat (they had four adults with them), and loudly opened the bags of food they'd sneaked in.  One moved to sit next to me after his family/friends picked on him. Kids reached between us to punch him.  They threw popcorn so that I had it in my hair.  People talked out loud to each other and to the screen.

Since it was a family film, I expected a bit of chatter and understood when I little girl had a freakout when the villain entered the scene.  But this was out of control.  I considered complaining, but I knew the manager couldn't throw out the entire audience for my moviewatching enjoyment.  

I tried to watch the credits to find out the name of a song in the film and was annoyed when the house lights went up and employees began sweeping around me.  I understand that our ill-behaved audience left a mess and they had another screening, but the film wasn't really over for me yet.

In all, I'll go back to netflix for my Center City moviegoing unless it's a film a the Ritz.  I can't blame the theater for most of my negative experience.  I think it's just the behavior in Philly theaters that bothers me.  Sorry, Bridge...it's a nice building but I just can't handle the other patrons.","Text1: Oh Philly, I miss you and your indifferent baristas.

This is a very family friendly location, too, so bring the kids!","Our family loves to come down and hang out under the sails along the canal for the free concerts sponsored by the Eiteljorg Museum during the summer evenings. This is a great venue inside and out. Nothing beats a free concert, but if you need relief from the heat, the museum is open inside as well--and it's free! That's right! There is free admission during June and July every Wednesday from 5-8 PM. While you're in there, you can grab an appetizer from the restaurant and enjoy it on the outdoor balcony watching the concerts! Seriously, this is one of our favorite venues during the summer.

This is a very family friendly location, too, so bring the kids! 

 Text2: Our family loves to come down and hang out under the sails along the canal for the free concerts sponsored by the Eiteljorg Museum during the summer evenings. This is a great venue inside and out. Nothing beats a free concert, but if you need relief from the heat, the museum is open inside as well--and it's free! That's right! There is free admission during June and July every Wednesday from 5-8 PM. While you're in there, you can grab an appetizer from the restaurant and enjoy it on the outdoor balcony watching the concerts! Seriously, this is one of our favorite venues during the summer. There's nothing like the way the sunsets cast a warm glow over the downtown buildings.",yes

Try the Mediterranean and you won't be disappointed!

If you don't like an ingredient, swap it out for another at no charge.

This is as good as it gets in the Take and Bake department :-)

Even my kiddos love the pizza from here!

During different times of the year, they do cute specials like pumpkin or heart shaped pizzas.

See you soon!","This is review is for the PlayCare/Birthday Party option.

Wow!  The PlayCare area here is freaking awesome!  From a rock climbing wall to zip line to slides that were fast enough yet safe enough to keep both my 3 & 6 year old happy, this place has it all!  There is a crafting room as well as pretend area (think kid kitchens, etc.) and a toddler area.  The variety of play options here was incredibly diverse and the best I've ever seen in a gym.

Washrooms located right inside the play area and the coffee/snack area has a viewing area to watch the kiddos if you like.

While I don't plan on joining the gym here anytime soon (more than double the fee of GoodLife and the like) I can definitely see the appeal.

The entire area was completely pristine from top to bottom and the staff were friendly and the kids felt immediately comfortable with them.

1,"I am in need of a 399th review as the 400th review should be something special, and so, Fitlife Foods gets the final review before the big 4-0...0.

I've come here a few times, though I am not a member or a regular.  Usually, I'm here because I was lazy or forgot to go grocery shopping and Fitlife is infinitely better for you than going to any restaurant and obviously any fast food joint.

Essentially, its prepackaged meals-to-go, but fresh using local ingredients.  Step inside and you'll see a row of refrigerators along one wall with snacks on one end, breakfast on the other, and lunch/dinner options in all of the cases in between.  Food ranges from your standard American fare - burgers, scrambles, BBQ, etc - to some asian items like Korean beef or pad thai, and some Mexican items like enchiladas and tacos.  All meals come in 3 sizes based on what sort of plan you're on - body builders would probably want the large meals for the extra calories, and fatties like me need small or medium meals because I don't have room for one more roll in my torso!

Each meal has the calorie, carbs, protein and fat count right on the side of the box facing the door to the fridge, and nutritional content/ingredients on the bottom.

I mentioned membership, above.  I don't know if that's what it is, but I know they have programs and whatnot to help you fashion a diet that's right for you, and whenever I am in there, I hear the clerk mention a person's total charge after a discount, so I assume there's a plan or membership where you can get that.  However, I have only ever gone here for 1 or 2 meals and infrequently, so I cannot provide more info.

They have microwaves there, so if you want to heat up your meal before leaving, you can, and they have some condiments and plastic ware to help you out there, too.  Very convenient.

The food is very good.  Some meals are obviously better than others, but I think I have liked everything I have eaten.  The korean beef was among my favorites, but the breakfast scramble was very good, too, as was some pulled pork option that I don't recall.

I'm taking a star away for price, which is not something I would normally do because you should know the price going in.  However, I don't think its always worth the price.  It's great to use in a meal emergency or every now and then to fill in the gaps, but there are cheaper services out there that deliver to your home.  One comparison to make this point - today, I bought a small breakfast scramble and a medium lunch/dinner option and it cost almost $19.  On the other hand, earlier in the year, I was using a meal delivery service - NakedFit Foods - and 4 meals a day, 5 days a week, was $150, which works out to $7.50/meal.  Almost $2 a meal cheaper.  Now, $2 may not be much to you, but it adds up if this is your primary meal source, and the latter option delivers to your door every night.

Still, price notwithstanding, I am a fan of fitlife foods for a good, healthy, alternative to nearly every other option.  And in my case, where my stomach, my rear end, and my head are jostling for having the stronger gravitational pull, I could use some healthy alternatives in my life.","Another trip to Skyway Jack's Pancake House, and another fantastic breakfast, minus the slow service.  

My last review was 5 stars, and I'm bringing it down a peg for the service because it was slow.  They were busy, so perhaps I shouldn't blame the server, but she disappears for long stretches and it gets annoying.  The fact is though I should probably only knock it down 1/2 star, but since yelp won't let me, and the food wasn't quite as wonderful, I'm rounding down.

Don't get me wrong though, it was still great.  Last time I got the Hobo Hash, which was different and awesome.  This time I got the Hungry Man Skillet, which is all the meats in a skillet with potatoes and eggs and onions and peppers.  It's also supposed to be toped with country gravy, which sounded out of this world (and may have made it better than the hobo hash), but frankly, I'm a fatty and didn't need the gravy.

Sat outside again.  It was a beautiful morning and a couple tables got up just as we were leaving (outdoor seating is first come first serve), so we were able to enjoy the weather.

As usual, Skyway Jack's serves big reasonably priced and delicious portions.  Looking forward to another visit, but we may have to avoid this server's section to ensure a reasonably timed meal","Text1: I am in need of a 399th review as the 400th review should be something special, and so, Fitlife Foods gets the final review before the big 4-0...0.

1,"I was so excited for them to open and my experience just sucked.  I hate to say that, but from start to finish it just wasn't that great.  

The tables are packed in. I understand wanting to maximize the space, but tables are uncomfortably close.  Our server looked miserable constantly squeezing out of someone's way.  

I was very unimpressed with the food.  I ordered the boneless wings after our server said they were fantastic.  They were not. I don't mind dry chicken, I think it can nearly always be overcome with a good sauce.  They were SO DRY, they were nearly inedible.  I couldn't even cut them with my butter knife.  They were also tiny.  I would estimate there was no more than 6 oz. of meat in my 8 wings.  I had requested celery, but it did not arrive.  I told my server and he told me that celery was an upcharge.  I told him it was included, but to just bring me fries.  He ended up bringing me fries and celery. I'm not sure if he checked the menu or just decided to give the celery to me.  I checked the menu again before writing my review and it is definitely supposed to be included with the wings.  The blue cheese and buffalo sauces were fine, nothing spectacular.  The fries were mushy, underdone, and underseasoned.  I ended up leaving half of them on the plate (if you knew me, you'd know how shockingly out of character that is).  And by leave them on the ""plate"", I mean leave them on the paper container they came in.  Everything came in cardboard containers.  Very weird and super wasteful.","Breakfast was swing and a miss for me.  I want to like this place so much, but despite being a diner with a huge focus on breakfast, I think they shine better at dinner.  Service was ok, nothing special, and kind of slow.  The quality of the food was average to slightly below average.  My hubby's grits were downright nasty. They were watery sludge.  

It's so close, reasonably priced, and I loved dinner the one time I went to a different location.  I'll be back to try them for dinner.  Fingers crossed!","Text1: I was so excited for them to open and my experience just sucked.  I hate to say that, but from start to finish it just wasn't that great.

1,"I wish I could give a more thorough review of Kajun's, but I really can't.

I got here expecting to be able to do a little singing and jamming. It wasn't late at all, but I was told that they were done with Karaoke for the night. Bummer. It was a decent crowd, although it was kind of packed. People seemed friendly enough and the bartenders had a nice beer selection and were fast despite the crowd.

I would love to go back and actually sing some karaoke. Hopefully I will find myself in the area again, soon.","I used to come to this place years and years ago when it was a dive bar that played Soulja Boy every single time you set foot in that place. I swear, that dude was that place's mascot. Anyway, Evangeline II is A LOT better than that.

Evangeline has a nice cozy feel to it, and although it's small, it still has an area for a band to perform. The night we came there was a pretty cool cover band on stage. They have a really good beer selection and I was happy that there was a lot of seating at the bar. The bartender seemed really friendly and laid back and was really good about being prompt with our order.

I definitely like this place as a laid back place to catch a band on the Avenue. It has a good atmosphere and a friendly vibe.","Text1: I wish I could give a more thorough review of Kajun's, but I really can't.

1,"I walked passed this restaurant every day for a whole year and never had the chance to try it until a friend of mine scheduled a happy hour gathering here one afternoon. 

There were 8 of us seated at our table, and it wasn't until after we arrived that we discovered the happy hour special on drinks was only available at the bar. This was not advertised anywhere on the menu or website. But it's not like all 8 of us could go sit at the bar and converse comfortably, so we chose to stay seated and pay full price for our drinks. That was strike 1. 

Our group trickled in in pairs every 10 minutes or so (people coming in after work or classes), and when we tried to order 5 dishes earlier on to share, the waitress told us she could only put in one full order, for the whole table, one time. I found her tone to be somewhat rude. She also said each person usually ordered 2-3 dishes on their own...but our party was there for HH, not necessarily dinner. So we waited 30 minutes for the the whole party to arrive to order the original 5 dishes anyway. Strike 2. Everyone ordered an oyster slider, which was great - probably my favorite thing on their menu, but $6 is pretty steep for a sandwich barely the size of my palm. We also got the hot chicken, shrimp and grits, mac and cheese, and the pork belly. The hot chicken was so spicy one of my friends couldn't eat any more after the first bite, but everything else was fairly yummy. The dishes are tiny though, and to think they cost $15 a piece...

With all the food and drinks combined, each person ended up paying around $20+, but our stomachs were still grumbling and we were so dissatisfied with the service that we moved our party elsewhere down the street.","I'm rarely over in the fairmount area, but I'll certainly be back to eat here again! I came to Buena Onda for a casual birthday celebration with a few girl friends and the food was really phenomenal. First off, the decor is really bright and clean and there is free beer from Yards while you wait! I got the chicken, grilled shimp and grilled mahi mahi tacos, and they were all delicious, though I would say the mahi was my favorite. We ordered the guac to share, and they have these great green and red sauces on each table which really kick the tacos up another level. The workers were also kind enough to let us light candles on our birthday cupcakes :) Overall a great dining experience!","Text1: I walked passed this restaurant every day for a whole year and never had the chance to try it until a friend of mine scheduled a happy hour gathering here one afternoon.

First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. ""This place would make a great business"" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.  We had the livery which is more of the standard and the carriage house which is more Texas, which is understating it because both are made with more than average ingredients.  Both were fantastic drinks! Upon being seated we were served some house made chicharones that were a nice crisp accented with a lime flavor that went well with our margaritas. I'm going to skip to the dessert because it blew us away!  The apple flan is a bit of culinary genius.  The texture was a silky smooth bit of creamy perfection served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side with a little garnish of a sweet cooked apple slice topped with I believe candied Marcona almonds. Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  They are making their desserts in house, and that includes the freaking ice cream.  I can't wait to see what kind of ice cream concoctions they come up with.  It's not my intention to take away from the small plates because we were not disappointed with our choices.  We shared the ceviche and the chicken empanadas.  Both were flavorful and delicious to the last bits. Lastly, Michael, Lee, and Phillip were all so very friendly and took the time to speak with us throughout our visit.

1,"Truly one of favorite places in all SB or Montecito. Sooo much better than Piatti was on its best day 

Tried the avocado and goat cheese sandwich which I never had (or any sandwich) because said it was on focaccia. 

This is a gross--but felicitous--misrepresentation

It's just a single piece of thick, fresh multi-grain bread piled high with golden (yellow) beets, an avocado puree (not sliced) and ample goat cheese. (Actually, maybe the goat cheese and avocado have been mixed). 

It comes with a side salad dressed with sherry vinaigrette I would almost think of trying to make myself. 

14 dollars. 

I will try the other sandwiches now that I know the bread is normal (and since it's open-faced), you're not eating that much bread anyway. You can sub fries for salad if you're not feeling virtuous. 

My new favorite sandwich!","OMG I can't believe this is on Yelp. I have written dozens of Victorian Chick blogs about this complex where I spent ten most horrifying, depressed years of my life. My graduate school debacle can't be blamed on Hope Gardens, aka Death Gardens, any  more than 9/11 (which I spent in this apartment), but certainly living her during both did not give me a fighting chance. 

I view the following as a public service announcement to fellow Yelpers even ""thinking* about renting here. 

Now, I moved out in 2006. So who knows who's running the shop now. But a nice old man owned it years ago. Then his mean Manhattan real estate mogul daughter took it over. 

The new paint looks like a baby's diaper with light-colored loose stool. I suppose technically it's ""sand,"" but here's a newsflash: SB ISN'T ARIZONA. In Scottsdale, you see this kind of color scheme but that's a *desert* for the love of God. 

Now, this ONE star is for a one-bedroom on Hope Ave itself. If you live on the indie courtyard, it will be far quieter and cooler. 

But living *on* Hope Avenue is masochistic unless you're deaf. Of course when I moved in, it was a de-facto convalescent home, so presumably half the tenants were deaf or getting there. I was one of the few people under 50 and one of only two or three graduate students. 

It was big for the money. But you get what you pay for. I don't like Upper State. At all. It's just a funky, weird, depressing part of town. La Cumbre is even worse and more depressing, but that's like saying it's better to lose a leg in a car wreck than a bike crash. They both suck. 

You have NO concept how loud the trucks are up Hope Ave. Six days a week it seems. The only quiet day is Sunday. Come Monday, it feels like you returned to prison after a 24-hour reprieve. As if the big rigs barreling up Hope Ave to Foothill weren't enough, you have THREE major banks on the corner of Hope and State (Wells Fargo, B of A, and Montecito Bank and Trust). (The sign says ""scenic"" route but I have no clue what that means as Foothill is hardly ""scenic"" and believe me, this is some official truck route). Of course no one prepares you for the noise because they want to rent the unit.

But wait, there's more! I was sweating and showering constantly from May 1st to Oct 15th because the units on Hope Ave have sliding glass doors in the living room and large windows in the bedroom with *afternoon sun*. This is a big issue with SB apartments, given the lack of a/c: does it have afternoon sun or afternoon shade. And I'm describing a downstairs unit.

If you live upstairs, you might as well move to Texas, except that in Texas everyone-not just the 1% as in Santa Barbara--has air conditioning because it's simply an inhumane and uncivilized place to live four or so months a year. Same with Arizona. You have to have a/c. And they won't let you put in a window unit, at least they wouldn't when I lived there. 

Well, Hope Gardens is just like Texas or Arizona four or five months a year with the heat beating down on the glass--minus the a/c. Back in the late 1990s, portable a/c units didn't work. I bought three and the only thing I accomplished was staining the hideous light brown carpet they didn't replace because a childhood friend was at Oxford and I was simply taking over the lease. 

Now, the pool is okay. It's all really old people but that's cool. This is SB, for the newly wed and nearly dead. But I took to wearing earplugs 24/7 for five years. This made it impossible for me to go even to Lazy Acres or CVS without plugs in my ears. If you go this route, please learn from my experience. You will get ear infections unless you wash them regularly (earplugs aren't meant for 24/7/365) or buy a few dozen pairs and rotate. 

Also know that the gardeners work on Thursdays (or one weekday) and with all that grass, you're listening to a cacophony of lawnmowers and hedge trimmers. If you're on the front like I was, you also have tree trimming to look forward to once a year. This is like Fargo without the buffets. 

I suppose a 9 to 5 worker will not notice this. And the traffic noise dies down by 7 or 8. 

I recommend drinking heavily the first two weeks of January because it's better than jumping off a building in despair that Christmas break is over, the only 10 days a year you can hear yourself think. 

I once read a review for a community college in Texas: ""Go here only if you have no other options in life."" That's all I can say. If you have no options in Santa Barbara except Hope Gardens, it's God or the universe telling you NOT TO LIVE HERE.","Text1: Truly one of favorite places in all SB or Montecito. Sooo much better than Piatti was on its best day 

Tried the avocado and goat cheese sandwich which I never had (or any sandwich) because said it was on focaccia. 

This is a gross--but felicitous--misrepresentation

It's just a single piece of thick, fresh multi-grain bread piled high with golden (yellow) beets, an avocado puree (not sliced) and ample goat cheese. (Actually, maybe the goat cheese and avocado have been mixed). 

It comes with a side salad dressed with sherry vinaigrette I would almost think of trying to make myself. 

14 dollars. 

I will try the other sandwiches now that I know the bread is normal (and since it's open-faced), you're not eating that much bread anyway. You can sub fries for salad if you're not feeling virtuous. 

My new favorite sandwich! 

 Text2: OMG I can't believe this is on Yelp. I have written dozens of Victorian Chick blogs about this complex where I spent ten most horrifying, depressed years of my life. My graduate school debacle can't be blamed on Hope Gardens, aka Death Gardens, any  more than 9/11 (which I spent in this apartment), but certainly living her during both did not give me a fighting chance. 

I view the following as a public service announcement to fellow Yelpers even ""thinking* about renting here. 

Now, I moved out in 2006. So who knows who's running the shop now. But a nice old man owned it years ago. Then his mean Manhattan real estate mogul daughter took it over.

After eating and the whole experience, spoke to the group and we all agreed the mood was somber in the place, the food was bland, it took a long time to get all the orders out from first to last, place gave you a feeling of being claustrophobic (only 4 groups of tables) so either you got intimate or like most people you just stand hovering over everyone waiting to take food out.

For $10, the size was meager and nothing special I could not make at home...  So not sure about our return.

From the experience, the parking, the hovering, and the time variability between orders would prevent me from returning.  That being said, if I was in area and it wasn't busy I would go back and ask for extra seasonings and some salt...

1,"Chef's Market has a very limited selection of items and generally offers more expensive gourmet options - things like pastas and sauces, cooking oils and cheeses - that are pricey but in my opinion not more pricey than anywhere else.

The reason I go here is for the produce. Their produce is excellent and extremely cheap, similar in price to a farmer's market but much better quality. I always go here for parsley which is $0.52 a bunch as opposed to $1.10 at the normal supermarket, just to give you an idea of price differences.

The major setback for me is that the staff is really grumpy and rude. It's not the kind of enlightened new-wave holistic food crowd you might expect.","This place is just the greatest.

First, the correct current address is 33 S. 43rd Street, between Chestnut and Walnut. Don't go to the old address like I did!

This place is basically a hole in the wall but they have EVERYTHING, and at great prices. Every time I have called for something they have it. I bought an external hard drive dock that has input for laptop AND desktop, both SATA *AND* IDE, for sixty dollars. It works like a charm.

Today I'm going in for an external CD burner with lightscribe capability, for $40!

I can't recommend this place enough when it comes to your computer item needs.","Text1: Chef's Market has a very limited selection of items and generally offers more expensive gourmet options - things like pastas and sauces, cooking oils and cheeses - that are pricey but in my opinion not more pricey than anywhere else.

The reason I go here is for the produce. Their produce is excellent and extremely cheap, similar in price to a farmer's market but much better quality. I always go here for parsley which is $0.52 a bunch as opposed to $1.10 at the normal supermarket, just to give you an idea of price differences.

The major setback for me is that the staff is really grumpy and rude. It's not the kind of enlightened new-wave holistic food crowd you might expect. 

 Text2: This place is just the greatest.

First, the correct current address is 33 S. 43rd Street, between Chestnut and Walnut. Don't go to the old address like I did!

This place is basically a hole in the wall but they have EVERYTHING, and at great prices. Every time I have called for something they have it. I bought an external hard drive dock that has input for laptop AND desktop, both SATA *AND* IDE, for sixty dollars. It works like a charm.

1,"It took a while to get here, enticed by the high ratings on Yelp, but now I understand the consensus of high praise.  Went on a Vets Day/weekday noon hour.....very busy but ample free parking....a rarity in Ybor.  We were greeted by some of the colorful Ybor free-range chickens who  were not part of the BBQ menu.  The grill/smoker is in the parking lot and trays of fresh-cooked meats are hauled inside.  Seating is limited and tables are shared in the converted shotgun bungalow.   The noise level makes conversation and even ordering difficult but worth the effort.  The pork and sausage we had were marvelous, beans were good and the slow-cooked greens and yellow rice were top-notch.  Certain dishes like turkey leg (Thursday) and Mac 'n cheese (friday) are only available on those days.  Several dessert options...no kiddie-sized meals.  We consider this to be top of the field, along with Alabama John's on 40th. .","Not a dive at all, but also not in contention for upscale panache.   A basic bar in stumbing/crawling distance of University of Tampa.  Prices are low and air is smoky.  Designed for serious drinking and lounging without frills.","Text1: It took a while to get here, enticed by the high ratings on Yelp, but now I understand the consensus of high praise.

We were seated immediately and it took awhile to look at the extensive menu. One of my friends was delighted she could order breakfast! My other friend and I ordered sandwiches. So, we all enjoyed our meals. 1. Scrambled Eggs and Challah French Toast - I tried some of french toast, it was great! 2) I had a cup which is HUGE of soup and a sandwich (also huge). The soup was Mushroom-Barley, very tasty and the sandwich I had was Greek Sandwich = feta cheese, spinach,tomoato and melted Mozzarella on a hoagie roll toasted. Very good. 3) Turkey Sandwich- had lots of yummy components : Smoked Turkey, Lettuce, TOmato and Honey Mustard on a hoagie roll. Wait staff very nice. We will come back.

1,"OK, I've got to downgrade my score a bit after my second experience. 

Came in with a decent sized group after attending wine on the river, so I must admit that parts of this meal are slightly hazy. However, after doing a bit of detective work, I have pieced together my experience. 

What I remember: 
-Ordering a turkey burger and the famous potatoes on the side
-Having one well liquor drink
-The potatoes being extremely soggy and floppy

Fast forward to two days later. This is me checking my credit card statement:

""Holy $*&^ I spent $50 at National Underground?? How did that happen?""

Then the pieces started falling into place. 
-I picked up the tab for my BF (still. TWO burgers and two drinks- a beer and well vodka should not be $50)
-We had to buy BOTTLED water. That cost $2 extra per bottle. 
-There was an up charge for the potatoes that were floppy and not good

Yikes. That's a lot for a drunken meal that I half remember. I had a good experience the first time when I was a bit more coherent, so I'm definitely going to try and be a lot more careful when eating here. If it's late night, I'm choosing Broadway Brewhouse, and next year I think Mexican food is more appropriate for post wine on the river food.","After seeing some seriously beautiful interior photos from Eater and Yelp, I was waiting for the right opportunity to give Caviar & Bananas a shot, and was happy I decided to come in on a Sunday for brunch. 
It was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). 
However, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. 
We had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.","Text1: OK, I've got to downgrade my score a bit after my second experience.

0,Orchid Thai is my new favorite Thai restaurant!

1,"You want art supplies? You've probably come to the right place! While I remember this store once being bigger than it now is, it does carry a good selection of high quality art supplies for people of all ages. Sometimes I wish there were more selection here, but overall if you need painting supplies or colouring books or some art-focused toys for children these items are likely there to be found.

I've never found this location to be particularly busy when I've visited, but I have made some good purchases here over the years.","This was my first visit to this particular location of Famoso. And while it was quite a wait for a table, the food was delicious and another restaurant patron gave us a coupon for $10 off our meal (it expired that day) which made our dinner more affordable than expected! 

Our table service was good and the food was really quite great especially as their January special was still going on at the time that we visited (a whole bunch of customer appreciation specials at $8/each).

1,"Was visiting Dunedin,  Fl. and a local recommend Kelly's.  We went for breakfast and it was an unexpected suprise. After walking into a smsll storefront, there was a big back patio area. 
 The food was eggs, bacon, toast, a sausage link, home fries and oj, for $7.99.
Bacon and sausae crispy,  eggs cooked correctly, toat still warm & buttered.  The OJ was yart, can't quite explain that one anf potatoes lacked any real flavor and were mushy
Our waiter fas quite entertaining and wide awake. The orders were correct and for the price quite good. It appears to be a local hot spot for all meals and happy hour. I will be back to try other meals & Happy Hour.
Very enjoyable establishment.","What can I say when you break down in the rain, ya gotta be glad to see a smiling face. My driver was terrific!  My car is my baby and I broke down in a second floor parking deck, with a very narrow & windy ( I mean steep curves) & a medium in the center & a wall on the narrow sides.
Definitely  not the optimal place to break down. The driver very quickly earned my trust & in the rain maneuvered by car out of the lot & down the long winding narrow slope. The slope is a blast in the car, but under these circumstances  took an expert that took his job seriously.
Action towing has some top not drivers to pull this maneuver  off. Then in rush hour traffic, we were off to the other side of town, where my mechanic is. Friendly, professional & personalised service is what I received. A great job, I wish I could remember  my drivers name, as he is the best!
Highly recommend Action towing to anyone!

1,"The Coffee Corner is located right on Broad Street in Lansdale.  You walk up a few steps as you enter the restaurant.  The interior is small but has booths along both walls with tables in the middle.  They have a counter towards the back and the kitchen is just on the other side of the counter in the rear.

My girlfriend and I had breakfast here on mothers day.  We walked in and chose a booth along the right side wall.  Our server came right over and took our drink order.  I had a coffee and my girlfriend had water.  After looking over the menu our server took our order.  She had a pancake, hash browns and pork roll and I had (2) eggs, corned beef hash and home fries.  Our food came out quickly and everything was very good.  The food here is simple but good and the service was great.  The only negative is that they slice their pork roll way too thin. 

This place has to be the best value for breakfast around!  Our total bill with tax was $13.20!  We will be back!

0,Definitely wanted to check this place out for a long time after hearing how it was basically a house tucked into the quiet Navarre neighborhood. The bar was fairly quiet the week night we walked in. There were a few friendly faces around the bar and a fairly nice bartender behind it. The place warmed up a bit when someone threw a dollar bill into the digital jukebox. The thing that stick out the most was that the bartender tallied each order in a notebook rather than a point of of sale system. Old school and quirky. I'm down.,"If you haven't heard, the Tuesday Blue Plate Special is now Tacos and it is a sure fire way to get a good Mex-Fix. 
You'll have three tacos; a chorizo, a carnitas, and a mixed-vegetable, along with rice and beans. As usual you'll get the flavorful house salad and a glass of iced tea. ( I love their salad dressing, wish it was available bottled.)
Now let's talk about the new blue plate itself. I'd be hard pressed to select which taco I thought was best, each was in a class of it's own.  I was surprised that I actually liked the vegetable taco. The broccoli had a crisp snap and the red pepper and onion added extra flavor.
The beans were just okay, need something to give it  a bang. Ask for their hot sauce, add it to the rice and you've got a great side to your tacos. 
This place is still the best value for lunch.","Text1: Definitely wanted to check this place out for a long time after hearing how it was basically a house tucked into the quiet Navarre neighborhood.

We got there in the midst of Sunday brunch rush. Yet were seated almost immediately. Our waiter was quick yet courteous, taking our order without fanfare. 

To our amazement, the food arrived within ten minutes, perfectly cooked to our liking. The over easy eggs were just so; over easy. Eggs Benedict were superb.

There was a menu flyer stuck in a drawer so we called for a pickup order.  Glad we did.  Some of the best pizza outside of NY or Chicago. 

The storefront is really plain, and entering, one is greeted by friendly staff.   The tattoos on the guy's arm made me a little weary, but heck, this is a blue collar area, so I gathered that came with the territory.  The pizza, however, was piping hot and absolutely delicious.

Get the Plato's Delight appetizer, which is edamame, corn, garlic, and red pepper sautéed in white wine and spices, drizzled with tahini sauce. It's amazing!

I usually get the duo plate with chicken and gyro meat. The gyro meat here always melts in your mouth. So good!

My wife liked the salad. She also ordered the meatballs that came out tender and tasty. On our last visit, though, the sauce was quite 'salty.' I had some afterwards and it did make me quite thirsty. 

 Text2: My first time at Subliminal I had the Cali turkey wrap I loved that it is prepared in front of you  They were training a new worker The girl at the register was not being nice to the new girl She looked like a bully Im  not sure that is the image that subliminal wants to put that out front.",no
1,"friend and i wanted to grab some grub before hamlet at the wilma. we didn't want fancy or bar food. so we got onto yelp and found this place. wasn't sure what to expect and when i opened the door, i was a little disappointed to see that the set-up was a little like shake shack...not that i dislike shake shack...just wanted more of a ""restaurant"" restaurant experience, and not a diner. well, i can tell you that my disppointment stopped there. 

marc (the host taking our order) was so incredibly friendly and fun! my friend ordered before me which gave me time to peruse their menu. she ordered a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and guacamole. marc made sure to express his surprise with the addition of guac lol 

i ordered the turbo which came with pickled jalapenos and added raw onions. my friend made a comment and marc gave me props for it because he also likes raw onions on his burgers. he really made my experience here great. 

since i work around the corner and love burgers, i will def be stopping by again. also, the burgers and fries are fucking delicious. the end.","i've been meaning to try this spot since i moved here but never made the effort until now. why now? because my friend from ca is visiting and she has never had sichuan food before. i usually go to a different spot but this was closer.

we walked in and were greeted...or i should say acknowledged. wasn't too friendly of a welcome tbh. we were seated and the first server was very nice. then we got another server...she wasn't rude, but also not great. she had a very brusque nature that i just didn't care for.

anyways, we ordered some beer, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the dry pot chicken. def pricier than my usual spot...the eggplant was very good. the dry pot was also good but i think i like the dry pot from my usual spot more.

we were hungry before we got there and were full when we left. we paid then left. easy...no fuss. if the service was a little better, i would probably give them an extra star. would i go back? sure, if the occassion arises but i don't think i'd go out of my way to come back here.","Text1: friend and i wanted to grab some grub before hamlet at the wilma. we didn't want fancy or bar food. so we got onto yelp and found this place. wasn't sure what to expect and when i opened the door, i was a little disappointed to see that the set-up was a little like shake shack...not that i dislike shake shack...just wanted more of a ""restaurant"" restaurant experience, and not a diner. well, i can tell you that my disppointment stopped there.

0,"If you're looking for a unique gift for someone this is a great place to try.  Third Degree has a variety of hand blown glass pieces made by several St Louis Artists. Ornaments, vases, bowls, glasses, and many other things that you decide you must have as soon as you see them out. The artists constantly make a variety of different pieces so if you don't see something you like the first time you go, come back another time.  There are always new pieces that might just pique your interest.

Also, if you're ever looking for something to do on a Friday evening, you should stop by the factory.  (Just make sure it's the Third Friday of the month). Check out their amazing open house (there is a link for them under Yelp Events if you're curious). You'll get to see demonstrations of the artists' work as well as look at all the new things they have made in the past month. While you are at it, you can also sign up for one of their workshops on making ornaments, beads, or paperweights - take home a little souvenir of your experience. Just a heads up, you may want to dress in layers. The hot shop may occasionally get extremely hot - I have found a few times in the summer I can't even sit there in jeans. 

I've heard the factory is a great place for events and venues, but did you also know they have glassblowing lessons?  That's right, you can learn how to make those one of a kind creations you see them selling.  Well, sort of learn... It takes a lifetime to master, but you would really be impressed with how much better you can get by the end of a semester. I took a series of glassblowing classes here through Wash U and loved it! Jon was my amazing instructor, and I highly recommend any of his classes. I am sure the other instructors are great too, but if I took another series here, I'd make sure Jon taught them. Glassblowing is a lot tougher than these masters make it appear. I can't tell you how many times I have messed up, but Jon really makes every student feel comfortable.  One thing I truly appreciate is his patience and flexibility. As beginners, it is very difficult to be able to deviate from your original plan, especially when something severely goes wrong and you cannot continue how you had intended.  Anytime a piece didn't come out quite right, Jon had an incredible amount of patience, foresight, and ingenuity to help us turn them into masterpieces we would love. (I am using the term masterpiece very very loosely here.  But if you compared the original to the final work, you'd understand why)  Examples? Lopsided, unusable cups into beautiful, decorative wavy bowls. Fat, overweight ornaments into delicate, impressive vases.  Destroyed, impractical bowls into useful paperweights.   My favorite part of the class?  Getting my own collection of handblown glass pieces that I made with my blood, sweat, and tears.  I highly recommend taking some classes here - who knows, you may find a new hobby!","They have a couple of really nice ladies, that go out of their way to help you. But there's one that will rip your head off if you're not careful. It won't take ya long to figure this out on your own though.

1,"Mmm, hibachi scallops :-)

I am a sucker for scallops -- so simple, but the flavors are not.  Well, my seafood dinner started out perfectly with the Benihana punch.  Haha, I am a Malibu Bay Breeze babe, so bring on the yummy rum and fruitiness!

Well, the hibachi experience at Benihana was predictable enough, but a good predictable as hibachi consists of clean, fun entertainment.  And, of course, there was the anticipation of a yummy scallop dinner, which I indeed had.  

Not bad for the suburbs, woohoo!  

P.S.: Thank you, Benihana, for playing ""Life Less Ordinary"" by Carbon Leaf ANNNND ""Hopeless"" by KT Tunstall IN A ROW while I was waiting for my hometown girlfriends to arrive ;-)","What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I've been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.

Like Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco's pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  

As serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  

The atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it's 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren't in the same family.","Text1: Mmm, hibachi scallops :-)

1,"from the outside doesn't look like much.  doorman def wants to see all ID no matter what age you are.   That says much to me.   obviously the first thought is there have been problems at this place so ID is a great way to say no to folks if they don't have it.  but thats okay, I can live with that.   I don't blame a good hood bar for making sure no ICKY folks come in.    Indeed.

AND being asked ID at the age of 55 is pretty funny.    I am old enough to be his mama.     its all in the way you ask.   and being positive when you do?  makes all the difference in the world.    so I laughed it off.

quaint inside, but LOUD.   jukebox played one song while we were there.    we ordered tacos and chips n queso which hit the spot, and was QUICK.     The kitchen was just getting ready to close up, so I really appreciated the waitress coming to our table and asking us if we were hungry since she was nearly closed.    THAT is something very special to me right there.  over the top nice and helpful.   She checked on us several times.   AWESOME  usually when kitchens in a bar are close to closing for the night?  that last order isn't what they are wanting to see.   LOL   thanks for being real.

drink wise?   pretty average.  they were busy, but not in the weeds.   the bartender kept up with everyone, and it all was super neighborhood.

curious to see this place during the gras or during busy times in the summer.  I'm a standard cocktail person and not really into experimenting new things.   I've been a bartender for a long time too.    I just am simple, hungry, thirsty, and happy.   AND I NEEDED a CIGARETTE.     that def made it for me.

see you soon.","thank you PJ. 
this was a great afternoon, filled with fun food.   the salad to start with, then we moved on to boudin, then onto brunch.   lots of fun here.

I just thought it was a restaurant, then realized that you got a butcher here, and lots of cheese.  you can shop up in here and bring home a killer dinner.  OR you can eat here.  we did tons of sampling, and a great bloody mary to boot.

I can see bringing lots of friends here over the next few months.  so nice to find a new spot for breakfast/brunch.  we will be back for dinner next.","Text1: from the outside doesn't look like much.  doorman def wants to see all ID no matter what age you are.

The first thing i noticed was the smell. I didn't smell burgers though, it smelled like a bakery...and it was awesome. I was perplexed, until i saw them baking the buns. This made me very excited.

I started with a shake, Irish Coffee. I was not in love. It tasted great, but it was way to runny. My dining companion's (Stephanie S..holla!) shake was also very runny, and hers was so boozy we both had trouble sucking it down. Love the idea, but these could use some tweaking.

Okay, so what kind of burger does a former vegetarian who has not had a burger in 3 years order? The burger topped with pork, of course. That is right, meat on meat. Bailey calls it the Carolina burger...i call it holy shite delicious burger. It was unbelievably good. The burger is topped with pork shoulder, and slaw. I took Tim G's advice and got the barbeque sauce on the slide. Now, i'm one to ditch the buns and go fork and knife on a sandwich, but these made-in-house buns were too good. 

You can't have a burger without fries, right? I would not suggest it at Bailey's Range cause i thought there fries were AWESOME. And get the rooster sauce. I don't know what is in this stuff, its a mayo based sauce and looks a little scary but it is so so good.

All in all, the food more than made up for the mediocre shakes. I would be more than happy to go back and indulge in some meaty nom noms.","Text1: Food looked good.  Nice decor.

1,"Stopped in for what my colleague and I thought would be a fairly quick lunch between appointments. We were referred to the hamburgers, prepared with local organically raised beef.

The crowd didn't seem too big. We had plenty of room for parking and available table immediately. 

After a while our server asked for drink orders... Limited to tea and RC products... Really -- RC?  I know it is a TN ""thing"" but seriously.

We each ordered a burger and fries.

Then waited. and waited. and waited.

We had a clear view of the kitchen, with looked to be moving and working, with 5 or 6 line cooks working.

The griddle didn't look small. But I from the time we ordered to the time we ate was 35-40 minutes.

For a burger.

I've come to expect a much faster burger service.

Gabby's (best in town) keeps a constant line moving with what - 2 people in the kitchen? Five guys same deal. The burger at Backyard Burgers isn't much worst than the one at Melrose... and they'll have it out by the time you get to the window.

So -- how was this burger?  Fine. Nothing special or un-special. It lacked any distinctive taste of being grass fed, like the most excellent burger at Gabby's. 

Fries were unremarkable.

In short, it seems the pub is more about the drink and less about the kitchen. And maybe if we were drinking for Friday lunch, we might have not though so much about the wait...","What a great add to the antiques district in Franklin! Honey's has every candy, old and new that I can think of. Lots of gross novelty things like gummy snakes and eyeballs and gooey things that 8 year olds go crazy for. And then all the things that I and my parents and grandparents remember from our childhoods. Who knew most of these things were still being made! The store is cute and different. It's probably more fun than the candy stores it harkens back to, with 50's styled tables piled high with various and sundry candies.

If you aren't into candy, the soda fountain will probably salve your sweet tooth with really good ice cream.

Sure, there were a few boring items. The satay, for example, had no flavor and was a complete waste of time and cash. But, how bout them SEXY GRITS? My dining partner isn't a seafood person, so we ordered a side of the highly recommended sexy grits ($5 cheaper than with the shrimp). Even without the shrimp, they were very sexy indeed! Creamy, cheesy, grits with tons of chunk garlic, diced garlicky tomato, and a bit 'of a yummy kick! I need to go back for this!! 

We also ordered a side of sauteed green beans (another garlicky dish that was delish). And last, but not least, the bacon wrapped dates melted in the mouth.

Modesto is still my favorite tapas restaurant in the City, but I will definitely be back to Mojo when I need to get my sexy on!!!","Text1: Above average pub grub, live music, low key neighborhood bar.  Clean, nice architectural features, nice staff. 

 Text2: I've heard mixed reviews about Mojo from friends, but my Hot Sauce coupon inspired me to forge ahead, and I'm glad I did! 

Sure, there were a few boring items. The satay, for example, had no flavor and was a complete waste of time and cash. But, how bout them SEXY GRITS? My dining partner isn't a seafood person, so we ordered a side of the highly recommended sexy grits ($5 cheaper than with the shrimp). Even without the shrimp, they were very sexy indeed! Creamy, cheesy, grits with tons of chunk garlic, diced garlicky tomato, and a bit 'of a yummy kick! I need to go back for this!! 

We also ordered a side of sauteed green beans (another garlicky dish that was delish). And last, but not least, the bacon wrapped dates melted in the mouth.

1,"Let me set the scene for you:

10pm-ish on a Wednesday night. Me and about 15 other drunk, sweaty runners just finished up a kickass 5 mile jaunt around South City. Yep, you read that right. I'm a drinker with a running problem. Don't ask any questions. 

Anyway, we weren't ready to end the party, so we hit up Barney's for more drinks and some food. 

Barney's is a hole in the wall dive in South City. On this particular night, it was pretty dead. Well, it WAS, until we came and stank up the place. The bartenders were super nice and friendly and didn't bat an eye at our ridiculousness. They kept the drinks flowing, and the food came out pretty quickly. 

The food itself? Not bad! I nibbled on some mozzarella sticks and had some thin crust pizza that had bacon, jalapenos, and what I'm 99% sure was provel. And it wasn't half bad!

One thing to note: if you start a tab, there's a $10 minimum that you must spend before you can close it out. Just something to keep in mind. 

Would I come here sober? Probably not. But on this particular night, Barney's was just what we all needed.","My boyfriend is a security guard, and when he invited me along with him to go shooting at Bulls Eye, I was terrified. I'm 23 years old, and I've never shot (or held) a gun in my life. 

For the most part, everyone here was very friendly and professional. They quickly went over the basics on shooting, and the fact that safety is a huge priority there made me feel a lot better. 

It was a great experience. I'd go back.","Text1: Let me set the scene for you:

1,"Remedy is a really cool place to kick back and relax.
The majority of patrons are students, art folk and bohemian hippie types.  The reason for this is the atmosphere at Remedy - it's very chill and laid back.
My fondest memory of Remedy is their apple pie.  Oh, how I love apple pie!
A lot of people go to Remedy for the chai.  If you are a big chai fan, you need to check out Remedy because it is their claim to fame.  Delicious!
The food at Remedy is, for the most part, Indian food.  It's a great snack and the spices will keep you warm on a cold Edmonton afternoon.
Remedy also serves desserts, beer, coffee, and some other drinks.  It's really just a great place to relax.
If you haven't been to Remedy, I recommend giving it a try.","Best Donair really does have good donairs.  I wouldn't day BEST but pretty darn good.

I still love the Hogg Slop, their interpretation of poutine.  Lately I have been ordering The Cure.

I would still recommend having reservations as this place is busy after all the social media buzz.","I reviewed this original location when it first opened, but somehow that one has evaporated. I hadn't been back here for a while and it continues to serve great pies.  The renovated entrance has improved the congestion at door.

This trip we tried the Blanca, which was a  nice change from tomatoes and meats, but the appeal wore off after a slice or two.  This would be great one to share with a group, so everyone can try something different. The Siciliana was absolutely perfect -- the sauce is divine and that thin, quick baked crust is how all pizza should be.

My only gripe with this chain is the poor quality of the Parmesan cheese. I just don't understand why they offer that awful, powdery stuff to put on such a quality pie.","Text1: Liked the first place a lot, love this one.

The dispatcher was a bit confused, but the driver arrived promptly (within 20 minutes of the call). And was courteous.  Not sure if they take plastic or not.  My houseguest paid with a check.","I'm so glad this is a restaurant space again. Pre-K I went to Christian's often and it was nice to back inside this churchy location.  

The food was wonderful. I started with a lovely mixed green salad with a pungent & delicious blue cheese. And then had the stuffed baked shrimp withe hominy cakes. Seriously tasty. My dining companion had a very lemony/anchovy-y caesar salad (and I mean that in a good way) and then stuffed salmon with gnocchi and asparagus. Since I sampled her food too, I thought the gnocchi were a bit heavy, but still delicious.  Then for dessert? AMAZING dark chocolate creme brulee. Seriously y'all, I love fancy chocolate pudding and this was the fanciest (and tastiest).

Only off note was that our server was struggling. The restaurant was busy because of superbowl weekend, but we never did get to hear the specials and had to ask for more bread.

0,"This review is only for the tall hurricane I had at Willie's, and not for the food, as I haven't had their food. On every block on Bourbon St, you can find a damn Willie's Chicken Shack. It did not help my sense of direction down there at all. Rather than go back and forth looking for a good place to grab a hurricane, my cousin and I opted to get one at Willie's. Here are my thoughts...

I liked the $15 price tag for a huge, collectible tall cup (you know the one that's synonymous with Bourbon St at this point) of hurricane. And I like that there was a good variety of different daiquiri flavors to choose from and/or mix. But, when it comes to the strength of my drink, I would suggest opting for another location or adding (several) shots of alcohol to kick it up a notch.

The flavor of my traditional hurricane slushy was good, but I felt like it was barely any stronger than what you find at a 7/11 slushy machine. I'm not going to lie though, I drunk it down fast, and it, mixed with the other liquor in my system from dinner that evening, did give me a buzz. I'm just saying I have reason to believe that another hurricane/daiquiri purveyor on Bourbon may have given me something a bit more potent. IJS.","Sorry, no.
Have visited twice, and those visits were months apart.

Trip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.

Trip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.

Hubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.

Again exiting the conference for an extended break as the City of Nashville's humidity finally gave way to rain, it was perhaps an oversight of Vanderbilt's love of a boozy brunch that saw us arrive at Tavern to the tune of a 90-minute wait, the time largely spent wandering nearby Centennial Park beneath umbrellas until a text called us forth from the Pantheon to be seated amongst a mass of humanity with well lubricated co-eds screaming to be heard above the loud tunes echoing from high ceilings overhead.

Dining with a pair of ladies from the era which several of the restaurant's 1960s tunes were sourced, and thus clearly not of a demographic common during the hour of our meal, suffice it to say that the ninety minute wait was further compromised by overstretched service that saw our table ignored until a manager was flagged down fifteen minutes later, the kitchen itself equally stressed but trying to make good by sending out four scoops of luke-warm ""White Trash Hash"" as the wait-time for plates was extended another twenty-five minutes after the order was eventually placed.

Informed that desserts are only offered at dinner, and as such going even sweeter than usual with mains, it was finally the restaurant's thinly poured flapjacks that crossed our lips and although a better effort could have been made than a topping of pretzels straight from a bag it would be difficult to find any other fault in the buttermilk triplet, the sticky-sweet caramel finding an unexpectedly willing dancing partner in light chocolate mousse that produced a flavor not unlike that of tres leches as it soaked the pancakes straight down to the plate.","Text1: I just cannot like this place.

1,"Phonoluxe filled the void that the Great Escape left when it moved out of midtown.  If you like soul and motown, Phonoluxe is the place for you!  It's on Nolensville next to La Hacienda.  Perfect if I'm craving some Mexican.  Last time I went in I bought about 7 albums for around $30.  I went nuts.  Everything was used but in good condition.  If you are looking for newer vinyl Phonoluxe may not be the place for you.  They are now only open on the weekends but it's worth a stop in. (Note I'm only there for the vinyl so I can't speak of anything else.)","This place is SUPER cute! I've been doing two things with my maternity leave, hitting the parks and eating chicken salad. Well, I guess four, I'm keeping the little man happy and fed too. Off topic. I hit CDLC after Edwin Warner park and the Harpeth Greenway. That day in particular turned out to be exceptionally wonderful. CDLC has delicious chicken salad, it's up there, maybe top 3. I got a vanilla bean lemonade to pair. It sounds weird, but I promise it's tasty. It also has some really amazing desserts that cater to everyone, including vegans. I got a lemon bar and a vegan cupcake. Oh baby! I can't wait to try more.

The decor is very beachy, victorian tea house. I liked it, so does the 50 set. The staff was extremely friendly even with me coming in 30 minutes to close and attempting to breastfeed my baby. I don't recommend trying to do this, for you, for them, for everyone, but I do recommend taking a trip out to the shop.","Text1: Phonoluxe filled the void that the Great Escape left when it moved out of midtown.

0,"I was one of the first customers to come through the door on their opening night and I was greeted by all the staff. They were super energetic, friendly and helpful. My first impression was of the giant bar and the big mural of TUCSON spelt backwards on the wall, which I loved. If you look into the mirrors above the bar, it spells Tucson correctly for you, which was a cool design idea. The first night they weren't serving their beer cocktails yet, so I plan to head back in the next week to try those out. They did have local beers and wine on tap, I had a Papago Orange Blossom - one of my favorites, and my boyfriend had the Borderlands Citrana. After about an hour or so of quiet chat at the bar, the staff turned the lights down and music up. It became much more of a comfortable bar scene. Two fellow Yelpers Jide F. and Victoria G. joined us for some drinks and we ordered the Shepards pie and some fried pickles to share. OH MY the fried pickles were AMAZING. They are coated with panko crumbs, and something a little spicy which makes them out of this world. And,  the best part about the opening night, the food was free! I haven't been to Diablo Burger yet, but after sampling the food at the opening night of Good Oak Bar, I definitely plan to check it out.

For what this place offers and in a city as ethnically-challenged as Nashville, I really enjoyed what I was able to find.

Getting here was a bitch and a half for a pedestrian like me. I like that it's at a corner that is served by 2 bus lines. However, I had to walk up something akin to a freeway on-ramp to get here, since the little shopping center is on a sidewalk-less block of Charlotte, offset on a little hill.

The physical space was bigger than I expected. However, the amount of inventory wasn't as crammed into that space as I would expect from a world market.

The produce seemed sparse. I didn't see a sea of Asian greens. There was certainly more variety of produce than what I'd find at a Kroger's or Publix or Whole Foods.  But there are certainly other places in Nashville that would cater to specific ethnic groups that may have the produce you're looking for. When I come back, I will still look through the produce in the off chance that I find something that would inspire me.

The seafood section certainly had the space to cater to a lot more than what was offered. But I was there on a weekday afternoon, and the amount of customers present didn't warrant any stock turnover that indicated any freshness to me. I did appreciate that they had some live fish and crab and eel and crawdads. Yet I cried internally that Dungeness was nearly $20 a pound here.

I didn't look too closely at the meats. They had the offal (pork bung). I saw some lamb and goat and rabbits. And I could have asked if they had fresh pig's blood.

But as other Yelpers have noted, it's the non-perishable aisles that they're mainly here for.  I was beyond thrilled that I was able to find shrimp paste (bagoong), lechon sauce, banana ketchup, and even tamarind pulp candy (both the salty and sweet versions).

They have tons of varieties of noodles and instant noodles (I didn't notice if they had fresh noodles). Lots of bulk bags of rice and containers of soy sauce. Various grains, spices, candies, cookies, chips, etc.

Note: This is not a place you'd get customer service.

Bonus: No members of the ""Pink Mafia"" when I was here, thanks to Nashville's demo. The Pink Mafia are what I call the old, Chinese women who walk around with pink, plastic shopping bags and practically shove you out of the way and/or shout at you in Cantonese when they are buying produce. For an international market, the place hardly had anyone shopping there on a weekday. I'm sure the weekends might have more people.","Atmosphere 4 stars
Coffee 2 stars

I like going to Fair Grinds because I enjoy sitting there and working or chatting with friends.  However, I wish the coffee was better.  I find that no matter what, the coffee is always so bitter.  Yesterday, I went in to do some work and I decided to order a french press.  I specified that I wanted the medium roast because I knew the dark roast would be too bitter... even with the medium roast I had to add twice the amount of honey and milk that I normally would.  I keep hoping that maybe it was a mistake and I got the dark roast.

I still love the atmosphere, I'm sure I will try again... maybe I'll consider tea next time.","Text1: 2013/025

1,"This is more a venue than a park. At one end is a covered brick sitting area with restrooms, on the other end is the Ybor Art Studio, where classes are held. The park is home to a Saturday market that is fun and well attended. The grounds are very well maintained and well laid out to support the many cultural events that take place here.

There are even tables outside. The staff is friendly and will take you to a seat.

There is no question that Anthony's Coal House Pizza is one of the best pies around. Thin crusted and baked well in their very hot ovens makes a great combination. We liked the abundance of pepperoni and sausage on our selected pizza. There is plenty left over to take home for another meal.

We started off with baked chicken wings. This restaurant allows you to order any combination of wings, i.e. drums, wings or both. Our drums came out tasty with a good amount of cooked onions. The onions do indeed give it a special taste. 

My wife liked the salad. She also ordered the meatballs that came out tender and tasty. On our last visit, though, the sauce was quite 'salty.' I had some afterwards and it did make me quite thirsty.","Text1: This is more a venue than a park.

We ordered the white mushroom pizza which I really enjoyed, even though I'm usually not a fan of white pizza.  The red pie we ordered consisted of garlic sausage and caramelized onions.  It was decent, but the white pizza won my heart.

It's difficult to find good pizza in Philly and Kermit's Bake Shop is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  If they delivered, they would be extra cool.","I don't really have great things to say about Ants Pants, but I also don't have many bad things to say either.  It's just...forgettable.  

First, it's cash only, as are most places in this area.  The wait for brunch on the weekends is insane and in my opinion, not worth it.  You can probably make many of their menu items at home, and save yourself some money too.

While the decor is cute and my mom loved the granola and yogurt (which is near $7...highway robbery!), I'd suggest walking down the street to Honey's or Resurrection.

I had to up my review from a 4 star to 5 star.  We visited this location and I ordered the chili (as I usually do).  It tasted off and smelled weird.  I told the waitress that it didn't taste right and she took it away with no problem.

10 minutes later the manager comes over and tells me she is sorry about the chili and that she checked the batch and it was a bit over cooked/burnt. During the course of the day the chili temperature increased and burnt the chili. She thanked me and was really happy I told her .    I never expected that .. I just expected it to come off my bill.. Never that the manager would actually check the batch and act on me saying it tasted weird.  Bravo..  So glad we eat here a lot.  great place.","Hard to cover what hasnt been said already by the previous fine reviews.  My children and I love it.  Its alot of fun if the money is personally flowing and I make it a day in the park.  Hitting here then going across the street to the amusement park and after catching some Morning Call.    

The parking lot is currently getting black topped now which is way overdue.  Was a big eyesore compared to the polished City Putt.  

All the course is in fine working order and really is fun.  The only drawback we ever encounter is when parents with the ""only child"" have to play thru because, well, those kids get everything they want except for manners. So let little Abner or Veruca thru please!   Aside from that, its always a good time with my kids and makes an excellent drunk date activity.","Text1: We usually come here for a quick bite to eat.

-several well-maintained trails leading throughout the property - all are very tidy and friendly for children and the elderly (if you're looking for a challenging hike - this isn't it)

-spiffy restrooms 

-covered picnic area that is very new and well laid out with picnic benches and only a stone's throw from the parking lot

0,I haven't actually stayed at this hotel so the review I'm writing is based on special events I have attended alone. I'm always excited when an event I'm attending is hosted at the Union Station Hotel. It is in my opinion one of the most beautiful locations in town. Their ballrooms are spacious and great to host big tasting events such as Iron Fork I've attended many times. What is really impressive about this hotel is the Grand Hall with the wonderful Christmas light show and beautiful bar. I attended the Yelp Winter Wonderland in this location tonight which was illuminated by beautiful Christmas tree and lights in addition to their famous light show. The bar would be impressive for any date night when you're wanting a unique cocktail experience. Sometime I will also have to have dinner here as well.,Decent place to grab a quick lunch.  Had the slinger special.  Nice portions and good flavor.,"Text1: I haven't actually stayed at this hotel so the review I'm writing is based on special events I have attended alone.

1,"Nice divey bar in a strip mall on the far eastside.  Cheap reasonable brews.  Some good variations, but not a lot of craft options.  The main thing is the karaoke here.  Lots of regulars, so you need to be bold and get your requests in as soon as possible.  

Lots of room from groups. I did not try any food, but might on a future visit.  Check the website for karaoke times, but it appeared to be consistent as a 8pm start, but it didn't start for about 15 minutes due to some discussions with the regulars and some newbies like myself just looked around for some direction.","Recently remodeled Eegees on the south side near the airport and not too far from Valencia and i-10.  Almost always clean say about 9 out of 10.  Clean and usually lots of seats inside except for lunch times.  There is some outdoor seating in a walled area.

Food is sandwiches, but everyone comes for the frozen drinks.  IF you have NOT had an EEGEES drink then you have missed out on a excellent Tucson tradition.  You can get a mix with upto 3 flavors, sometimes more, But I don't recommend more than two.  

Single lane drive through.  I don't like how recently they park everyone, even when there is no one behind you.  I usually just pull to the front door and wait unless another car actually comes behind me.  Parking lot can be tight as it is shared with other businesses.

Biggest grips with Eegees is the changing coupon policies.  They used to take whatever, but now they are strict on dates and annual coupon card.  Also I believe they had discounts at age 55 but now they raised it.  They also got rid of the Frito Chilito after raising the price several times.","Text1: Nice divey bar in a strip mall on the far eastside.  Cheap reasonable brews.

0,"I spoke with their receptionist today (I believe she called herself Francesca, but I could be wrong).  The answering machine allows one to leave a message and be called back within two hours as they were not open at the time I called.  That was very helpful.  I was then transferred to Sean Brady whom I left a message with.  All in all, it was a pleasant transaction.","Needed to find a place to dine with my folks and my aunt and uncle inside the, ""Inside"" strip (E, SL, CC), so I picked this place as most restaurants you pay close to the same price for 1 dish as you can for AYCE, and tonight was seafood night $25.95, and $3 discount for locals w/ proper ID. 

I ate at this restaurant many years ago when it first opened and it was not impressive, which was strange as we used to dine in the old buffet which was across from this one, and that was always 4 to 5 stars. 

I didn't eat here for a long time, then heard it was good again, tried it and agreed. I ate here 2 more times and both times were 4-5 stars, that is if you got the dishes that always look the best and the ones you like.

Tonight really was impressive, we were quickly sat, and served, I went out to get a plate and saw the mushroom ravioli and decide to load up, I got about 8 to 10 of them, and most places that would be all you get for $18 (probably a couple less raviolis too), but then I added tortellini, a small serving of lasagna, a loaded baked potato, fresh medium rare prime, and grabbed my seat. Everything was 5 stars, even the potato was excellent! 

I was sufficiently stuffed, but it's kind of pricey, so you got to dig in and go for the uncomfortable stomach for a couple hours, so I grabbed another plate, and loaded up crab legs, mussels, and peel and eat shrimp. Again, all 5 star dishes. I was very shocked to have so many different dishes on such a high level! 

Service was great, all plates quickly cleared, server was available anytime for drinks, napkins, etc. 

Last I did desert, I again went for a belly buster consisting of cheesecake, butter finger something, flan, and mint chocolate chip gelato. The gelato was the star of this show, with everything else being delicious. Glad to see an old favorite come back to life and deliver an outstanding meal for my party of 5 with the greatest of ease!","Text1: I spoke with their receptionist today (I believe she called herself Francesca, but I could be wrong).

0,"I'm loving this whole fresh local food trend. It makes me feel so healthy (even though it may not be). 

So the last time I was there, I ordered the Spicy Avocado and Lime kale and grain bowl. It was delicious!! It was so filling that I was able to share it with someone else. The fiancee ordered the buffalo chicken burger and wasn't all that impressed. He said it was kind of boring. So I guess it's a hit or miss depending on what you order.

My only complaint would be some of the employees - having to deal with unpleasant people kind of ruins your dining experience just a bit.","I have only been there for their lunch buffet, and it's excellent. There's a pretty wide variety and the food is of fairly high quality. My favorite is the lamb curry, which is chopped up lamb with bones in a savory sauce that's excellent with the rice or the naan (garlic, of course). For about $9, it's a very good deal.  

My only issue is that none of the dishes are really spicy. That's not atypical in the midwest, but it would be nice if there were some spicy dishes. Quite a few of the patrons appear to be ethnic Indians, which says to me the food has not been Americanized too much.","Text1: I'm loving this whole fresh local food trend.

Got the creamed spinach for an appetizer, the Double Cut Filet Mignon, and Morton's hot chocolate cake, which oozes godiva chocolate and has Haagendaaz ice cream on the side.

I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely forget to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve???

1,"Crocodile Catering did a lovely job with our office meeting. The burgers were thick and juicy, there were beans, chicken breast with melted cheese and BBQ sauce. I also noticed fresh green salad with various dressings., along with chips. The pasta salad they served was great! The food was plentiful and they didn't run out either. They even packed generous portions of food for employees to take home. The help was pleasant & prepared. I was very pleased with the experience and would recommend them highly.","I've lived in the area for almost thirty years and this was my first time eating at Tortugas! Recommendation came from a friend who has been here. She knows I love Mexican Food so I was interested in it, I didn't think Tortugas could be as good as my fave, El Limon.

Strike one, the hours on Yelp and on their sign said they were opened at 4:30- when we arrived, the lights were off and it was dark. I really was irritated with that. There is confusion with the info on the website versus the menu. The web says they offer drinks and cocktails etc, the menu says it's BYOB - ummm so which is it?! I asked the server and its BYOB, they offer one free margarita a certain day and time range but I honestly forget what the server told me. I don't drink, so I don't care. I do want other Yelpers to know about the drink situation- remember it's BYOB.

The server was a young lady with strawberry blonde hair, extremely friendly and attentive. They served us delicious chips and a side of luscious pico de gallo. It was fresh, with just the right amount of heat, diced onions and cilantro.  My order was three enchiladas one cheese, chicken and beef with rice, no beans. The rice was tender, moist and flavorful- no dried up peas and carrots either that seem to be the standard in Mexican Rice.  The chicken and steak were delicious and tender, it was shredding right from the fork.  I didn't detect much seasoning though in the meats. The cheese enchiladas was stuffed generously with cheese.  My friend ordered three cheese enchiladas w rice and beans.  

The delicious food and kind service made me forget about the restaurant being closed when I showed up. I would definitely come back again! This may very well replace El Limon as my fave! Can't wait to bring my family here soon.  I think the meals are a little more thank what you would expect but it's worth it- the quality is there!

Keep up the great work, Tortugas!!","Text1: Crocodile Catering did a lovely job with our office meeting.

Don't judge! :) I got the Ultimate Omelette and it was still pretty yummy. Our bartender was ok, but didn't go out of his way to be friendly and never once smiled. Probably won't visit here as much anymore simply due to the happy hour changes.","Petsmart is my go to place to get Charles handsome! I take him here once a month to get washed and cleaned and I have never had an issue with them. I can always get an appointment made when I call. They have always treated Charlie with great care and I love that they give me  notes on how everything went and what products they used.

The price is very affordable, for a wash and nails clipped it costs me only $27 and that includes brushing his hair, cleaning his ears and teeth and the regular wash and dry.

I don't think I would take Charlie anywhere else. Petsmart is close and convenient to me and the price is very easy on my wallet and the service is consistently good.","Text1: Went to the Hermitage location 2 days ago for a late brunch with my bf.

I tried both the original and acai pomegranate (which came highly recommended by the girl behind the counter). Both were delicious but not quite right. Basically they both had a slightly icey texture but quickly melted. Does that make any sense? It just wasn't as smooth and creamy as other fro-yo places I've tried. I topped both with kiwi and mango. The kiwi could have been much more ripe, but the mango was perfect! The yogurt was tasty irregardless, but was a deliciously soupy mix by the time I reached my car a few minutes later. I'll gladly be back for more (like i said its tasty) and hope the yogurt consistency is better my second time around.","ICC is not going to blow you away by being the largest convention center, or the most technologically savvy.  However, their service is quite up there!  Hoosier Hospitality has been the name of the game for Visit Indy (formally the Indiana Convention and Visitor's Association) and has been how they have set themselves apart from other similar sized convention center cities like Orlando, Denver and Charlotte.  Although you do not think of Indianapolis as a world-class city like a New York or Los Angeles, many conventioneers will tell you that Visit Indy's service is second to none and it is why they choose Indianapolis.

The physical center is very good.  The layout of the center is very convenient.  There are very large central hallways and pre-function spaces.  The center is more than adequately marked with signs.  The skybridge network that connects almost every major hotel in downtown with the Convention Center and Circle Centre, eliminates the cold weather argument for many conventioneers.

The lighting and large pane window views are very pleasant.

The only drawback is the food, although good and tasty, is nothing that you will remember or tweet a photo about.  I hope that they will get more creative in presentation and flavors and get away from the same old chicken dishes, but that is a minor thing and I will blame the meeting planners for trying to pick a ""safe"" dish that everyone will like.  I personally would like to see more daring food offered that will definitely be remembered.

Great beer selection and a full bar menu with friendly wait staff. The food we tried on our visit was OK. We had the spinach artichoke dip, nachos, and loaded waffle fries. Nothing to write home about, but they did the job at 12:30am. 

Advisory: Cops are ALWAYS out on Charlotte anyway, and now they are even more vigilant with this new bar. Our friend was pulled over immediately (we were going right down the street) because of a ""glaring headlight"" (what the heck is that??). So be warned: the cops aren't messing around and don't drink and drive anyway!!","Brunch is phenomenal here! Mexican breakfast is something I cannot get enough of. I loved the omelet and fried potatoes, and my husband loved huevos rancheros. Specialty coffee was strong and delicious, and a half order of their french toast makes a perfect ""dessert"" to top things off.

The bill seemed just right for portion size and quality.

I also LOVE the decor. From the outside you wouldn't expect it to be so beautiful inside. Nice work, Delicia! I will be back for more!","Text1: I'm so excited they opened a Melrose on the West Side! I love the interior, and they have a great outdoor space for brews with a breeze when the weather nice! Great beer selection and a full bar menu with friendly wait staff. The food we tried on our visit was OK. We had the spinach artichoke dip, nachos, and loaded waffle fries. Nothing to write home about, but they did the job at 12:30am. 

Advisory: Cops are ALWAYS out on Charlotte anyway, and now they are even more vigilant with this new bar. Our friend was pulled over immediately (we were going right down the street) because of a ""glaring headlight"" (what the heck is that??). So be warned: the cops aren't messing around and don't drink and drive anyway!!

1,"A friend told me about the Honu last night on FB, given that I adore Hawai'ian inspired food, I made the decision to go today! I'm really glad I did. 

It's located right off Main street in Dunedin, in an adorable cottage/bungalo that is very welcoming and bright. Parking might be difficult at first, but Dunedin has plenty of street and public parking so that's that. 

Once inside, I was seated and the specials were gone over.  The menu itself was quite extensive too!  I decided I wanted to do things the Hawai'ian way, and went for the plate lunch: Agave Pork, green goddess slaw and potato mac salad.  The table next to me, three wonderful ladies also made the same order, so we shared in the community of the same food and chatted while we waited. 

When the food was delivered, it was obviously made fresh, smelled great and tasted even better! The green goddess slaw was unlike anything I'd ever had before! It was light, fresh and tangy, the flavor was bright on the tongue and I really couldn't get enough. The Potato-mac salad was out of this world.  The agave pork was a bit on the sweet side, but I liked it fine. 

I actually ate every scrap of food on my plate, the portions were JUST right!  I opted for dessert, because really who can resist? I chose their ""that's how the cookie crumbles"" Which was immense! warm chocolate chip cookies, fresh whipped cream.. all served sundae style. Honestly it would only be made better if they sold it WITH their macadamia nut ice cream!

Over all, the food and the service were absolutely amazing! I will most certainly be back","A friend won tickets to see Gary Valentine at Side Splitters and asked if I wanted to join, and since it was a Thursday night, I said SURE.  I've not been to Side Splitters since the late '90's and thought why not. 

The place really hasn't changed. The waiting area is still predictably small, and the seating area is still a bunch of small (VERY) small tables pushed together onto a small floor where the comedian stands on a stage and does his/her schtick. They have a 2 drink minimum, and prices are... well, they're not cheap. 

The entertainment we saw, The first, a local fellow from NPR (poor guy - I grew up there, I KNOW all too well the tribulations of Redneckville) was decent.  I liked him, but I think the crowd didn't know how to react to him.  The headliner? He was funny. I'd honestly not heard of him, but recognized him when I saw him. He was on King of Queens, and he had us ROLLING. 

Over all, the show was a fun outing.  They did say there would be trivia after the show to win prizes, I waited around.. trivia never happened.

***EDIT TO ADD***

So a friend of mine just related this to me:  ""I had paid by credit card, left ""in Cash"" on the tip line and left her $3 bucks in cash at the table.  When I checked my statement, I saw that she added a $5 charge for the tip, to a $14 bill?  I don't think so.""  This was on Tuesday.  She tried to get a hold of them, but no one answered. Finally she got through and she was supposed to hear back from them on Wednesday. Of course, she never got a call back. Today, she received a message from their Manager stating that a mistake was made and that $5 would be credited back to her card. 

I find this slightly shady, honestly. Not everyone checks their bill, and $5 here and $5 there adds up quickly when you're padding your tips.

0,"I've been going here for dinner and drinks with friends on Monday nights for quite some time and it's definitely become my regular pub of choice, due in part to these friends who go here frequently. As a non-drinker (for the most part), I am mostly concerned with the food quality, which is excellent! I adore their food specials for special events such as holidays (the Canada Day specials were delicious for example in 2014, as was the St. Patrick's Day special). The soups are consistently unusual but good. The Monday night steak special with all you can eat sides is a consistent favorite for our group.

My friends really enjoy trying the great drinks from their 72 taps and other drink menu, and I happen to like having a blueberry tea here on occasion, though it's rare to see me drink alcohol. We love the service we get when we come here!

Don't forget to order a yummy dessert if you do eat here: the tapioca dessert is especially good as is the Bailey's Creme Brulee and the Chocolate lava cake.","This place deserves your attention. Locally owned, full of craft beers (that are good), a LOT of food, beer, drink, margarita specials.  Food is good, good bang for your buck.

1,"Not going to lie, I think this pizza is actually pretty darn good.  I know every single shop they have looks a little ghetto, but have you tried the pizza?  It's seriously good.  

This pizza is huge, and cheap, and dripping with cheese.  Seriously, oozing cheese.  It is St. Louis style pizza, so if you hate Imo's I would steer clear of this pie, but if you are a fan, guess what, it's cheaper and they don't charge for delivery.  Granted, they don't have the same fabulous salad, but if you want pizza, this is your place.  Also, the cheese garlic bread is delicious.  I am a huge fan.

I almost could give these guys 5 stars because they are open so awesomely late (they deliver till 3am) which is certainly a plus when you are up late after a long night out with friends and desperately want some pizza.  Even when you order it this late, the pizza is still piping hot, too.  That never happens when I order in this late at night.","I really think this is the best wine shop in St. Louis.  I know a lot of people that prefer Starrs, but I just love this place.  

They have a massive assortment of wines in the shop.  Not being a wine connoisseur myself, I have partaken in more than one box of Peter Vella in my day, I always feel a little, well, inferior when I go into wine shops.  Usually, the people that work in them seem so pretentious, and I seem, well, like I drink boxed wine.  This has never happened to me at Grapevine.  The workers are all super friendly and don't make you feel ridiculous for wanting to keep the price tag under $12.  They will even find you a GOOD wine for under $12 if you tell them what it is you want.  

An altogether pleasant wine shopping experience, and it sure beats shopping for wine at Dierberg's.","Text1: Not going to lie, I think this pizza is actually pretty darn good.  I know every single shop they have looks a little ghetto, but have you tried the pizza?  It's seriously good.

1,"I love me some Cheeseburger In Paradise.  
CIP's menu suits my taste buds very well.  There are many things that sound good.. but I almost always get the same thing.  The Jerk chicken wrap with sweet potato chips.  Occasionally, my stomach will come calling for some dill pickle chips too.  

The atmosphere for those who haven't been is 'Paradise', but not over the top tacky like some other places.  They have a tiki bar in the middle for your drinking needs with some TV's and such.  There is a good amount of room within the restaurant with a nice area by the patio for larger parties. We've never had a problem with service. They do get bogged down at times, but always take care of us.  

They have a decent mixed drink menu, but I think their beer selection is one of the things that is really lacking.  I'd love to see this beefed up a bit with some more Caribbean flavors and choices.  

The food is great.  In my opinion the quality is very good for the price.  I love the jerk chicken wrap as its something you don't see many other places (I would like to see a grilled jerk chicken wrap).","Great place for a nice, quiet dinner with the wife or a client.

0,my mouth waters when i think of the yummy food they serve. love the all you can eat buffet.,"If you like quality food, then you will like Turchetti's!  I went to the grand opening and was fortunate to get there just before the lunch rush.  It's located within the former ""Marrow"" space, so parking is limited to street parking in the area.

Inside, there is a window processing area at the front, and once you get into the main area, the order counter/cooler/bar are on the left side; the two-top tables are in the middle; and the 4-top tables are on the right with the curing meats in a windowed room beyond those.

While waiting to place my order, I noticed the menu boards for sandwiches, burgers, and sides posted above the cooler filled with packaged meats to go.  I picked up a pack of beef franks and one of beef summer sausage.  

I was welcomed by the cashier who explained a few things to help make the visit informed.  I started with a double order of N'Duja Deviled Eggs (they come as half eggs) and went with the Pastrami (Reuben).  They also have a variety of beverages including Pepsi products, sparkling water, and a few beer selections.

After paying, they gave me a card to place on my table so that the server could bring out my order.

After a brief wait, the eggs were delivered.  Wow! The flavor was great.  I ate each half like it was an amuse bouche.  The yolks were flavored and though I can't tell you all the ingredients, the creamy texture and the light bite of the egg white added to the layered flavor (definitely an hint of vinegar & mustard seed).  They aren't filling and are worth a taste.

The Pastrami was delivered soon after and was excellent!  The rye was lightly crisped for that satisfying crunch.  Inside, they have the pastrami layered with Swiss cheese and ""gardenkraut"" topping and a bit of 1000 Island dressing for more flavor.  Simply delicious and it paired well with my Central State IPA.  

The only negative I had was that the place was getting quite busy since it was opening day and the line was backing up.  I think once the cashier doesn't have to take time to answer a lot of questions about the place due to all the new customers, things out to go more quickly.  Still, the line was moving pretty well while I was there...maybe 5 minutes from door to placing your order.

0,"Happened upon this little shop en route to another destination.   Because fishmongers are hard to come by in Bucks County, I felt obliged to stop and check it out.   The first thing you notice is the utter absence of a fishy aroma.   Exactly the way it should be.   The counter help was very helpful.   I was looking for stone crab claws, and the counter help suggested Jonah crab claws instead because they were available and less expensive.  The Jonah claws were terrific, firm fleshed claws very similar in texture to stone crab claws.  Also picked up a pint of their home-made oyster stew, which compares favorably to that of Sansom Street Oyster House.   My only quibble is that it needed a few more oysters.","The Coffee Corner is located right on Broad Street in Lansdale.  You walk up a few steps as you enter the restaurant.  The interior is small but has booths along both walls with tables in the middle.  They have a counter towards the back and the kitchen is just on the other side of the counter in the rear.

My girlfriend and I had breakfast here on mothers day.  We walked in and chose a booth along the right side wall.  Our server came right over and took our drink order.  I had a coffee and my girlfriend had water.  After looking over the menu our server took our order.  She had a pancake, hash browns and pork roll and I had (2) eggs, corned beef hash and home fries.  Our food came out quickly and everything was very good.  The food here is simple but good and the service was great.  The only negative is that they slice their pork roll way too thin. 

This place has to be the best value for breakfast around!  Our total bill with tax was $13.20!  We will be back!

Works for me. We both ordered the steak burger ($9) -- Stuffed with gorgonzola, arugula and balsamic onions. I believe it was a brioche bun.

You could get THE BURGER with fries or a salad. I chose salad. She chose fries.

We opted for a booth, which are so delightful and private. They're totally enclosed on three sides. You slide in, and you're in your own world.

Back to THE BURGER. Quite rare. (They didn't ask about how you wanted it cooked, but I think that's because it's steak.) Full of flavor, really a nice, rich beef taste. I should have ditched the bun. I didn't see the arugula, but the gorgonzola and onions were in perfect proportion with the beef.

The challenge with this rare of a burger is the bun gets soaked with juices when you put any pressure on the sandwich. And you DO have to squash it a bit to get it to fit into your mouth. Or just to cut it. That's when the bun gets in the way and becomes superfluous.

The menu didn't say how big THE BURGER is, but I'd suggest it was into hefty ouncedom.

The salad. Torn romaine (not massive leaves that required cutting), Kalamata olives (sans pits), tomato and cucumber (no seeds) pieces, red onion, and feta. Italian (light?) dressing. So flavorful. So good. I could have eaten a platter of this salad. It was delightful!

The fries. I tried a few of my dining partner's. Flavorful, battered (?), seasoned with something lucious (I'd guess paprika from the look and the taste). They were fabulous and cooked just right -- plenty crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.

I took half my burger back to the office and had it as a snack late in the afternoon. As such, it became my dinner.

Service was lovely. We were never wanting for water refills.

I like this place . . . the food, the ambiance, the service, the happy greeting when you walk in the door and the parking lot.","Text1: I didn't even realise this place exisited despite working ONE! BLOCK! AWAY! 

It's pretty overwhelming at lunch, there are loads of different counters to get your grub churned out cafeteria style.  I never know what I want and I feel like the Soup Nazi (or Sammish Nazi) will cut me off.  The place could use some clear ""order here for ____"" signs.  That would solve the confusion for me.

0,"I live down the block from Kelly's Kitchen and sadly the strip mall location really didn't make it like an appealing place to have breakfast. Thankfully my Yelp app compared it to my ALL TIME favorite bfast spot - Old Croydon Cafe - so I decided to give it a shot. Overall, a solid old school diner experience. 

The inside of the place is a lot more modern than I expected, also much more spacious. It has plenty of seating room for parties mostly of 4 and singles at the bar top. Our server was very friendly and came promptly giving us the daily specials. The prices are great for the amount of food you get, especially during the week! 

I decided to order the Bensalem Special - 1 pancake, 1 french toast, 1 sausage, homefries, bacon, AND two eggs over easy - ALL of this only $8.50! Needless to say I got through half and was STUFFED. You can easily share this plate with one other person. As for the pancake, it was very regular, nothing notable. The homefries were fancy, I love when places add some spice. They also had a huge list of omlettes that I would like to try.

Our server was friendly and kept our coffee cups full - which I love. I even asked for a spoonful  of the gravy for future ordering reference and she brought out a small bowl and it was delicious. I would definitely come back and make sure to bring CASH!","I Love this place - the food is good.  You have to realize the space is tight - so it's close seating.  Hang and there and just think about the ""Pancakes and the large portions of food you will receive"".

0,We visit at least once weekly. The quality of custard is unmatched. My 3 year old loves it. I ordered once and forgot my wallet at home and they gave me my order for free. I love how they employ the youth just wish they served strawberry scoops everyday!,"ICC is not going to blow you away by being the largest convention center, or the most technologically savvy.  However, their service is quite up there!  Hoosier Hospitality has been the name of the game for Visit Indy (formally the Indiana Convention and Visitor's Association) and has been how they have set themselves apart from other similar sized convention center cities like Orlando, Denver and Charlotte.  Although you do not think of Indianapolis as a world-class city like a New York or Los Angeles, many conventioneers will tell you that Visit Indy's service is second to none and it is why they choose Indianapolis.

The physical center is very good.  The layout of the center is very convenient.  There are very large central hallways and pre-function spaces.  The center is more than adequately marked with signs.  The skybridge network that connects almost every major hotel in downtown with the Convention Center and Circle Centre, eliminates the cold weather argument for many conventioneers.  There are more than enough restroom facilities that are well thought out.  The temperature is always appropriate, but generally on the cool side.  The lighting and large pane window views are very pleasant.

The only drawback is the food, although good and tasty, is nothing that you will remember or tweet a photo about.  I hope that they will get more creative in presentation and flavors and get away from the same old chicken dishes, but that is a minor thing and I will blame the meeting planners for trying to pick a ""safe"" dish that everyone will like.  I personally would like to see more daring food offered that will definitely be remembered.  And for those few that want something different, have a ""safe"" alternative ready for the naysayers.","Text1: We visit at least once weekly. The quality of custard is unmatched.

0,Love their $5 specials!!!,"When a new business sign went up on 54th in SoBro, it did not go unnoticed.  I patiently awaited the opening of the new Taco place and was pleased when neighbors on my Nextdoor app began raving about it.  

My girls and I made a bee line to check it out.  We ordered tacos, chicken & steak burritos, a chicken quesidilla and queso w/ chips to go.  As we waited for our order, we saw a familiar face in a neighbor that lives on our street and learned that she was one of the owners.  

The girls loved their lunch & took the leftovers to munch on during their play rehearsal.  The burritos were delicious, however, it took a moment to figure out which was which because I didn't see or taste the meat right away.  A little sparse for my liking, but I'll know next time.  

They have quite a few options on their menu that I'm looking forward to trying.  Happy to support a true locally owned business!","Text1: Love their $5 specials!!!

1,"I freakin' love this place.  The downtown location was a favorite of mine when I worked in that area, but now they have opened one in Brentwood, near the Chick-Fil-A.  So, when I'm out there, I have more than one choice of places to eat!  

Actually, they have had a Chile Burrito restaurant out there for probably over a year now, but they have just redone the entire strip mall (yes it's the 'burbs, of course it's in a strip mall!) so they have a nice shiny new place.  

These are burritos to order--just like in the other location--so you pick the kind of tortilla, then choose what you want in it.  Fresh ingredients, and lots of them!  They also have salads if you don't want to go the burrito route.  And cheese dip!  And spicy, fresh salsas!  

Thank you, Chile Burrito, for bringing fresh food in a non-chainy atmosphere to Brentwood!","I'm going to be the bad person and give Samurai only three stars.  I know everyone loves it.  All of my friends do, and it's on everyone's top list for sushi in Nashville.  I have to say though.  I've been three times, and have been disappointed each time.  

It's a tiny place--which isn't bad, but you often have to wait for a pretty long time.  And, because there is no lobby or seating area, or even a bar away from the diners, that means you wait outside.  Fine if the weather is nice, but maybe that's one of my problems...I have only been when it's either raining or 100 degrees outside, or both.  

Our service has been bad two out of the three times I went--a ""total fluke"" my fellow diners tell me.  But two out of three?  Anyway, it was slow, and I was brought the wrong sushi roll and they forgot my edamame.  Which, in my book, is a cardinal sin.  I LOVE some edamame.  

As for the sushi, it was good, yes, but not mind-blowing.  In fact, on one occasion I had a tuna roll that was warm.  As in, not heated, but it had been sitting out under some sort of heat lamp I'm sure of it.  I like my tuna sushi cold or room temperature.  Yuck.  

Clearly, from all the reviews below, I need to give this place one final chance--I'll be sure to go when it's not hot and/or raining, and at least I will have a better start to my experience!  I still think Virago, while not an authentic sushi house, has the best in Nashville.","Text1: I freakin' love this place.

1,"Nice location in the Spring and Summer as there is decent out door seating available. Iron Hill food is pretty good on the whole and a step up from most pub fare. I had the fish tacos on this visit and they were tasty. Food is a little pricey, but only slightly. The menu is fairly large and has some healthy options.

I am not a biggest fan of Iron Hill beer, it is good but I have tried a few variations but none have really stood out. Their beer is very good in this setting. The restaurant's interior is also very nice and our service was good also.

My friends and I sat outside on a beautiful May afternoon. It was really the only good choice we could find in the area for out door dining. We had called the Yard House and there was a wait for outdoor seating. This location doesn't also seem to get as crowded as the Maple Shade location.

Hippie factor: Baby organic dry goods section is fantastic with many options. Organic frozen foods, however, continue to be lacking when compared to Kroger ...no real surprise there but I was hoping to be wowed.

Certainly will feel more comfortable sending the wife and kid here instead of the Meijer at Lafayette Rd.","The special Bui sauce.. hm.. tangy, spicy, it's a mixture of some not so common Asian flavor. Price is cheap, but flavor is just ok. Also it only opens rush hours, so if the doors are shut, it means shut. I tried meatballs and some steak sandwiches. They are okay. I think meatballs is little heavy with binders and hard to taste the meat. I can tell the sauce is definitely some jar brand.","Text1: Location opened mid-May 2014, just a 1 minute drive east from I-65 exit 130.

Want an instant bronzed tan without the standard orange day-glow you've had before or seen on others? NO MORE ORANGE! Check out the Versa Spa spray tanning booth here.

It's not great.  But, some of the dishes are pretty darn good.  The price is right, and it seems like they're constantly cleaning, which is a good think in a buffet style restaurant!

My favorites are the Coconut Chicken and the Peanut Chicken, they seem to be a cut above similar dishes at other Chinese Buffets.  The rest of the food?  It's hot, fresh, and filling, if a bit bland.

It's one of those places I stop when I'm hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, but still get a good meal.  However, I wouldn't plan a special occasion here.","I liked this place quite a lot. The service was excellent, and the food was very good, indeed.

The gravy on the Biscuits and Gravy had a nice kick to it, which is important to me.  The eggs were done exactly has I ordered, and they brought me a carafe' of diet coke, instead of constantly coming by the table to refill it.

The one downside...which caused me to downgrade it from a 5 to a 4, was there was some confusion whether we were to pay at the table or at the door, as we checked out.  Other than that,  a stellar experience!","Text1: I'm not sure the food rates a solid 3 star rating, but the overall experience probably does.

My favorites are the Coconut Chicken and the Peanut Chicken, they seem to be a cut above similar dishes at other Chinese Buffets.  The rest of the food?  It's hot, fresh, and filling, if a bit bland.

It's one of those places I stop when I'm hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money, but still get a good meal.  However, I wouldn't plan a special occasion here. 

 Text2: I liked this place quite a lot. The service was excellent, and the food was very good, indeed.

The gravy on the Biscuits and Gravy had a nice kick to it, which is important to me.  The eggs were done exactly has I ordered, and they brought me a carafe' of diet coke, instead of constantly coming by the table to refill it.

The one downside...which caused me to downgrade it from a 5 to a 4, was there was some confusion whether we were to pay at the table or at the door, as we checked out.  Other than that,  a stellar experience!",yes

1,"Went to the Village Pub last night for the first time & really liked it!  I am a wine drinker and was a bit worried hence the ""beer garden"" moniker, but was pleasantly surprised to find several very affordable white & red selections.  I had the Tilia Torrontes and that was pretty good at $6!  

The service was good, and the place just smells of newness.  That being said it's a rehabbed old house so it still has the vintage feeling of East Nash.  We sat on the patio which was nice but we will venture inside next time.

I really appreciate the local ingredients on the menu & something other than the typical fried bar food.  We had the soft pretzel which was so good - very soft, just the right amount of crunchy salt, and very yummy & yeasty.  We had it with the stone ground mustard & a side of the Yazoo cheese sauce.  The only reason I do not give 5 stars is due to the cheese sauce.  The flavor was nice but the texture was really grainy and a bit strange.  I know, I know, I am picky, but still, overall we had a great time & will definitely be back!","I visited Taziki's for the first time a few days ago.  I am not impressed.  Why?  Well, there are a couple of reasons: customer service (or lack thereof), and the food.

1) Customer Service: 
I walked in the door and no one greeted me.  It took me a second to figure out where to go and order, and where to get a menu.  IMHO the register should be close to the door.  You have to walk past all the cooks to get to the register.....weird.  When I made it to the register, the cashier wasn't very helpful.  He just kinda stared at me for a few minutes until I ordered.  I ordered the Dolmades plate and a water.  I asked where I need to get my water and the cashier pointed to the counter to my right.  I sat down and waited on the food (I'll get to that).  I sat in the room with the windows, and there were 4 other tables in there in addition to mine.  A lady came through, and I kid you not, asked every single other table if they were ok, needed anything, needed to-go boxes, etc - but did not come by my table once.  Why I wonder?

2) Food:
I was really craving falafel, but soon realized they do not make it or serve it.  I was bummed, but I saw the dolmades plate, which comes with a Greek Salad, Greek Dressing, Taziki's sauce, and Pita.  And I ordered it.  The dolmades themselves were unlike any I've had before - they were gigantic and I could not cut them with a knife.  I basically obliterated the first one and just picked the rest up with my fingers (quite messy).  What I didn't like about them is that they tasted of nothing but lemon pepper.  Not fresh lemon, I'm talking lemon pepper seasoning, and a ton of it.  Just ruined it for me.  There was a ton of salad in the middle of the plate which was fine......I mean, it was salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and red peppers.  Nothing special.  I was very puzzled with the pita....there was one very small, very thin pita chip.  That's it.  I guess I expected a bit more than that and I would have welcomed it - with all that lemon pepper the whole plate was an acidic mess.

I did enjoy the ambiance so there's one positive thing.  Doubt I'll be back though...for nearly $11 I felt a bit ripped off.","Text1: Went to the Village Pub last night for the first time & really liked it!

0,"Three cheers for Herbie's! 

I visited here a few months ago with a friend. The place itself is pretty nice; there's definitely a French theme going on there. 

Our server was initially a little standoffish and pretentious; I'm not going to lie. I was not a fan of the service at first. But something -- either the fact that I whipped out my DSLR and started snapping pictures or the fact that we weren't punk kids -- changed, and he became a lot friendlier as the evening went on. 

I started with their Sage N Stormy drink -- dark rum, apple spice ginger liquor, simple syrup, lime, and sage made up this delicious drink. I guzzled it down and had to go for a second. Yeah...it was that kind of night, y'all. 

Food-wise, I went with the lobster mac & cheese. I recommend going with the smaller portion, because I opted for the larger one (fatty, fatty, two-by-four...) and it was WAY too much food. 

Oh, but it was so good. Rich, creamy, FULL of huge lobster chunks, topped with crispy breadcrumbs...it was heaven in a bowl. 

My friend ordered the peppercorn & coriander encrusted yellowfin tuna. It was served with an edamame and shiitake mushroom risotto, tempura bok choy, and a wasabi soy sauce. I had a few bites and it was pretty good, although I enjoyed my mac & cheese more. 

For dessert, I went with (what else?) their bread pudding. I honestly wasn't a fan of this; it was made of some sort of hard french croissant, which made eating it sort of challenging. The ice cream that accompanied it was almost bitter, and the stingy drizzle of chocolate sauce did nothing for the dish. Meh. 

The waiter also brought out a chocolate fritter on the house for us to try. Again, I think this had more to do with the fact that I had a camera in my hand than anything else. But I'll take it! 

This, my friends? This fritter was delicious. It was a crisp outer shell with the richest, most sinful dark chocolate inside. I could have eaten ten of these. Thank goodness he only gave us one. I have no self control.

All in all, it was a good experience. Would I come back to Herbie's? Sure. I'm in no rush to return, but the food was good, and once our server warmed up to us, the service wasn't too shabby either.","My second visit to Mac's was mostly good. Their beer list seemed to be largely leaning toward the Wheat side this past Friday night. I ordered a Boulder Sweaty Betty and was happy. My friends ordered mac and cheese which I happened to steal a bite of. It was gooey and cheesy and kinda tasted like someone cheese grated a bunch of Doritos on top to give it a nacho cheese dusting. It was OK but I wouldn't order it again. I don't know what it is but I am never that satisfied food wise here. I must be getting the wrong thing. Beer wise, they have a pretty decent selection and a cool jukebox with the Beatles making regular appearances. Until next time....","Text1: Three cheers for Herbie's!

She was accommodating, but we had to send back meal due to an error w the kitchen accidentally adding cheese. No problem though. But I finished my meal before his plate was returned.

We recently discovered that they deliver to my home, which is awesome for when I'm studying and have no food in the house.

The people who take my order are always courteous, and the people who deliver are very kind and are quick to crack jokes with you.  The delivery service here is awesome!  I never have to wait too long, and everything makes it to my front door before the bread gets soggy and gross.

So, as mentioned previously, the tuna is where it's at.  There is no relish in their tuna, thank goodness, it's just delicious.  No nonsense, just tuna the way the tuna gods intended.

The bread is perfect, the sauce is tangy, the cheese is all melty, the balls are all meaty....yum...

The mushroom are the same, though they can be a little hit or miss....sometimes they have been left out for too long and are squishy, sometimes they weren't in the fryer for long enough and are almost all raw, and sometimes they are the picture of the perfect fried shroom.  Their ranch...dear lord...their ranch...it is delicious and the perfect consistency...yes, their ranch is some of the best I've had.

Their number 1 breakfast combo might be the best hangover cure in Indianapolis. I know my order by heart: spicy biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, sausage patty, and obviously, some hash browns. 

Biscuits is located in a strip mall, so it's a little unassuming, but make no mistake about it, this place is 0% fancy and just 100% delicious food. Even when they're busy, the staff is attentive and the food comes out fast and hot. A hidden gem not to be missed in Indy! 

I've never eaten anything other than breakfast here, but I've heard they have good margaritas and good lunch/dinner, so next time I'm needing a Mexican fix, I'll have to head here and try it out.","My husband and I, recently, had a rather comical experience here! I am not a huge advocate of fast food, but we passed Wendy's and decided a couple of frosties would hit the spot. The inside of the restaurant was dead; there wasn't one single person inside, but we still decided to go through the drive thru. We pulled up to order and no one said a thing. We waited and waited, saying ""Hello?"" into the box and there was no response. After waiting for nearly five minutes, we pulled up to the first window. We could see one employee, but there back was turned to us and they were far enough away to not hear us talking, so we pulled up to the second window and there was still no one. At this point in time, I am telling my husband we should just forget the frosties and go. All of a sudden, a woman appears, frantically putting on her headset. She apologized and was nice but it didn't exactly make up for our waiting time or the fact, that NO ONE was even around to do their job. There wasn't even a person wearing their headset. Now, I could understand this if, lets say, they were actually busy, but we were the only customers they had. It took her and another employee about five minutes to get our frosties and then they didn't give us spoons or straws. We asked the gentleman, who was working, for both and he just walked away. Eventually, the lady noticed we were still at the window and helped us out with our straws and spoons. I was bewildered by this whole experience; all my husband and I could do was laugh!

I've never eaten anything other than breakfast here, but I've heard they have good margaritas and good lunch/dinner, so next time I'm needing a Mexican fix, I'll have to head here and try it out. 

 Text2: My husband and I, recently, had a rather comical experience here! I am not a huge advocate of fast food, but we passed Wendy's and decided a couple of frosties would hit the spot. The inside of the restaurant was dead; there wasn't one single person inside, but we still decided to go through the drive thru. We pulled up to order and no one said a thing. We waited and waited, saying ""Hello?"" into the box and there was no response. After waiting for nearly five minutes, we pulled up to the first window. We could see one employee, but there back was turned to us and they were far enough away to not hear us talking, so we pulled up to the second window and there was still no one. At this point in time, I am telling my husband we should just forget the frosties and go. All of a sudden, a woman appears, frantically putting on her headset. She apologized and was nice but it didn't exactly make up for our waiting time or the fact, that NO ONE was even around to do their job. There wasn't even a person wearing their headset. Now, I could understand this if, lets say, they were actually busy, but we were the only customers they had. It took her and another employee about five minutes to get our frosties and then they didn't give us spoons or straws. We asked the gentleman, who was working, for both and he just walked away. Eventually, the lady noticed we were still at the window and helped us out with our straws and spoons. I was bewildered by this whole experience; all my husband and I could do was laugh! The service might not have been up to parr, but thank you, Wendy's for the good laugh!",no
0,"Went to the Village Pub last night for the first time & really liked it!  I am a wine drinker and was a bit worried hence the ""beer garden"" moniker, but was pleasantly surprised to find several very affordable white & red selections.  I had the Tilia Torrontes and that was pretty good at $6!  

The service was good, and the place just smells of newness.  That being said it's a rehabbed old house so it still has the vintage feeling of East Nash.  We sat on the patio which was nice but we will venture inside next time.

I really appreciate the local ingredients on the menu & something other than the typical fried bar food.  We had the soft pretzel which was so good - very soft, just the right amount of crunchy salt, and very yummy & yeasty.  We had it with the stone ground mustard & a side of the Yazoo cheese sauce.  The only reason I do not give 5 stars is due to the cheese sauce.  The flavor was nice but the texture was really grainy and a bit strange.  I know, I know, I am picky, but still, overall we had a great time & will definitely be back!","Let's get one thing out of the way at the beginning.  I know next to nothing about Arnold Myint.  I mean I am aware that he is a hometown kid gone big time on TV, but that is about the extent of it.  I have never seen top cook or been to any of his other restaurants.  Heck he might have been the person who prepared my food during my visit to am@fm.  He kind of looked like the guy on the poster, but that is a glamour shot so who knows.  All of this is to say that I had no preconceived notions of what am@fm would be or what to expect.  

I went during the farmers market lunch rush and sat at the counter instead of going the carry-out  route.  The counter space and the additional seating are both a significant step up from the normal farmers market environment.  Real silverware, clothe napkins, wine glasses for water, you get the picture.  

I ordered the counter special which was a crostini plate with four different types of crostini.  This was not a pre-prepared dish, it was acually made to order by maybe-Arnold-Myint on the spot.  While it was being prepared I was given a small bowl of the house made potato chips which were excellent.  The crostini arrived and between the four of them they offered what almost amounted to a full course meal.  There was the heirloom tomato and basil crostini (salad), the artichoke goat cheese crostini (app), the dill egg salad crostini (main), and the ricotta peach and honey crostini (dessert).  They were all excellent and actually filled me up far more than I expected going in.  To top it off I got a small slice of brownie and some blueberries as a bonus.  All in all it was a completely satisfying meal and a complete surprise in the farmers market.  

For all of this I paid a whopping $8, a fantastic deal and what you would pay for a combo set at almost any other restaurant for lunch. 
I don't know if the counter special will be a daily feature or if I just lucked out on the day I went.  The sandwiches and salads also offered a lot of variety and were very reasonably priced.  You could get a half sandwich (3.75) and a side salad (2.25) for 6 bucks and have a pretty awesome light lunch.   I also saw a couple of customers who just went with a sampling of 3 salads and they seemed to be very pleased.  

So value + quality + nice setting = a very satisfied customer  

Overall, I think that am@fm is an outstanding addition to the farmers market and to Nashville dining as a whole.  They have fresh creative food at very reasonable prices.  I know that I am already planning multiple visits back to see what else they will offer.  

I went to am@fm with a clean slate, I left nothing but a clean plate.","Text1: Went to the Village Pub last night for the first time & really liked it!

0,"We ordered takeout.  A separate container for buns, potato chips, sauce, coleslaw, cornbread and beef.  Beef was in plastic bags.  Coleslaw and cornbread were good.  Beef left a smoky natural gas aftertaste that felt weird.  Smelled like a campfire.  We bought some potato salad from a grocery store instead of using the bun and potato chips.  They gave us a lot of sauce.  I would like to know how they prepare the beef....that much smoke can't be healthy.  We would try elsewhere next time.","While the brunch is not as good as Cafe Lift, in my opinion, I am a fan of Honey's.

I like the location a lot and the decor is very quirky. 

Service here is good. We got our food pretty fast on a busy day and when no one is there, it's usually less than 15 minutes.

My negatives are that the prices are a little too high. Extra for fries? Not cool, but at least the fries are great.

Cash only makes it difficult sometimes and while I probably will not dine here for quite some time, remember to get cash ahead of time so you don't have to bite the bullet with ATM fees.

Overall, I love their comfort food but specifically the Shrimp Po'Boy, the fries, and the Jewish Apple Cake (which I have had better but I am still  a sucker for).

Definitely give Honey's a shot, I think most people will like it.","Text1: We ordered takeout.  A separate container for buns, potato chips, sauce, coleslaw, cornbread and beef.

Soups, salads, and sandwiches available for lunch. I had the mulligatawny and it was great! Tasty and healthy.

This review is only about the experience I had being physically in this location to return equipment. My experience with them through their 800 number remains a mixed bag.

Based on the info you get online from people who've had horrible experiences returning their boxes, I was prepared for the worst. I took pics of the serial numbers before I went in. Because I was taken aback at how nice the place looked, I forgot to take a video of me handing over my equipment to the guy taking my info. He listened to what I was there for, then assigned me a number. 

I sat down on their comfy cushions; the entire room felt almost like a lounge. There were a few people ahead of me who had extended issues, so my wait time was longer than the other Yelpers. When it was my turn, I honestly expected to be told that they just lost the equipment I had turned in and that my fees would be in the thousands of dollars. Nope. If anything, they told me that Comcast owed me a refund. Cool bonus for me was that the guy handling my cancellation was also a fellow Bay Area transplant.

I was out of there in 30 minutes, stunned but hopeful that I will get my refund within the standard ""5-8 business weeks"" timeframe.

Update: Just wanted to add that I did get my refund within 2-3 weeks of being in my new place.","Text1: Wow, I can't believe how great this little store is! Whether you want to grab something for lunch, or need to pick up some organic produce, this is a super convenient location!

1,"FINALLY!

This salon has everything that I want (except a debit/credit card machine)...

1. It's in my neighborhood and there's plenty of parking around.

2. The decor is welcoming and rustic. You can tell they're not trying too hard (like Salon Blush) but it's also not grimy or under-decorated (Shampoo Bar Salon & Spa).

3. They use natural products that don't smell toxic or abrasive. 

4. They let people bring their doggies inside. There were two dogs when I was there, and they were just running around being playful and entertaining.

5. They open at 9 am on Saturdays. With so many people having Saturday weddings that start in the afternoon it can be really hard to secure a 10:00 hair appointment just to have it last an hour and then have to rush home and do your makeup and get dressed before hitting the road to get to the wedding. The 9:00 open-time is a real blessing.

Now onto brass tacks... I saw Bridget for an updo for a wedding and couldn't have been happier. She was super friendly and tried very hard to accommodate me. She stopped what she was doing several times to have me check the progress and point out what I liked or didn't like. When she was done and I was doing my final check she told me that if I didn't like it she would ""take it all out and start over."" That wasn't necessary, but it was really nice to have someone actually care more about whether their client liked the product than to just churn people out as fast as possible.

The cherry on top is that all of the ladies that work there are super cute! It's always nice to go get your hair done by someone that actually looks good themselves. 

The next time I'm due for a haircut I'm going to try them out and see if I am still as happy. I suspect I will be!","When I would frequent Spice Corner I was in college, broke, and not into cooking at all (unless ""cooking"" frozen foods counts). The only reason I'd go is to get loose teas at a reasonable price. I now regret not living closer because I've developed a taste for coffee and cooking, and Spice Corner serves the cook and coffee drinker with their diverse selection of spices and many flavored coffee beans. The only downside of this place is that it's quite small and it's difficult to maneuver around in. It's all worth it in the end, though.

As it's located in Downtown, however, the feeling's a bit different.  It was reasonably hopping on a weekend night, and something tells me it gets nice and crowded when it needs to.

Don't come out of your way for a burger, though.  Ours took forever to arrive, there was way too much bun in the package, and they were vaguely reminiscent of bowling alley burgers.  The fries upped the average, though.  Still, with a sub-$7.00 pricetag, though, if this place was downstairs, I might be singing a different tune...

Lots to do here: pool, whatever they call that scaled-down shuffleboard bar game, arcade games, a nice long bar.  It'd be a fun place to hit up with a bunch of friends for a party.  I didn't get a drink, but the bartenders seemed knowledgable.

Will probably be a while before I'm back here -- it was a burger contingency after the Tap Room announced an hour's wait for a seat -- but I have a feeling Jack Patrick's won't let me down when I return.

0,"Pretty tasty Thai food from a food truck. Food is served pretty quickly, but at the price of watery sauce. Staff is very friendly. 

I tried the red curry with beef. The sauce was essentially soup. But the flavor was good, and they gave a generous amount of beef and bamboo. It came with a good amount of jasmine rice. 

There is a small, basic room next to the truck if you want to ""dine in,"" but you'll still be served with plastic containers and utensils.","I wanted to write a quick update for The Habit for vegetarians. The Habit has an awesome veggie burger, and even though it is more expensive than the standard beef burger it is all dressed up. It comes with sprouts, tomato, onions, lettuce and some kind of sweet sauce with orange slices on the side. You also get the choice of regular bun, wheat bun or french bread--the french bread makes the sandwich quite a bit bigger. 

Avocado and cheese are both extra, but the avocado really makes the sandwich. Pair it with some fries and you have a delicious vegetarian meal. Thanks, The Habit, for offering a veggie burger (not to mention salads) for vegetarians.","Text1: Pretty tasty Thai food from a food truck.

0,"$4 smothered onion hashbrowns, wheat toast with apple butter, and three eggs.  Love it!","My guy and I recently started Paleo. After hearing amazing reviews from friends that whose culinary judgement we trust, we decided our last hurrah breakfast was going to be here. We were honestly overwhelmed with our choices and had no idea which route to take. So - he got the breakfast Mexican Sandwich and I got the Biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. We also both got a small mimosa. 

Let's start with the mimosa. It was really good, but honestly - it's the size of 3 normal mimosas. And it's served with ice... interesting. Not bad - just interesting. 

I tried his breakfast Mexican sandwich. The bread... Ohhhh the bread. It was the better choice of our two selections. Very flavorful and the bread is just - well it's almost croissant like. Almost.

The biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. Let's start with the gravy. If you choose the spicy option - it just has a little kick. Not a dropkick - so don't be skurrd. It's called the biscuit skillet, but honestly - I detected not one single bite of biscuit. Maybe they crumbled it up for me into teeny tiny little biscuit bits. I don't know. It was basically a skillet full of tasty slop, but I probably won't get it again.

The atmosphere: We went in on a Sunday for brunch so it was crowded. One of the first things we noticed was that their ""outside seating"" was in the parking lot. No - like... REALLY the parking lot. Just seemed less than restaurant-y. Kind of grimy and dirty... but you get the choice as to whether you want to sit out there or not, so I didn't mark down for that.

When we walked inside to wait - there was definitely a line and a LOT of confusion. There was no one taking names, waitresses and host were seating people. We did get seated rather quickly, but there was a lot of apologizing and shifting as we hovered over the table next to the front door.

I'm sure we'll be back at some point - but there was a lot of hype to build this place up and in my opinion, it was good.... Just not OMG!!!","Text1: $4 smothered onion hashbrowns, wheat toast with apple butter, and three eggs.  Love it!

1,"A New Orleans institution, especially if you grew up or spend a lot of time in Mid City.

Pandora in my opinion makes the best snowball in town, and they are the only place where you can grab a snowball and then walk a couple of blocks and eat it in City Park.

The waits can be long at times, but IMO they are worth it.

I think the first time I ever went here was when I was 10 (good ol 1991) as my grandmother didn't live too far away and we were always over there. So because of that I'll always have fond memories of this place.","I always prefer local spots over the ""bucks"" whenever I can. 
Nice environment, outdoor seating and they make a mean cafe Au lait. And the location is top notch right off esplanade kinda hidden.

1,"I love Sephora, I really do. Like most women, this place is like catnip for me. But this is the smallest Sephora I have ever been to. Even the one near my mother (who lives in basically the middle of nowhere) is larger than this location. I had such high hopes, after all it took them so long to put a shop in Philadelphia. 

They also do not carry Bourjois or Anna Sui products anymore. Over all, disappointing but better than nothing.","Although I lack the gene that allows a person to get excited about sports, I still love seeing games at this stadium. It is so well designed, there is hardly a bad seat in the house. Even the ones in the pavilion take my breath away. And I love, love, love how the city is framed in the outfield. 

The stadium is located in South Philly, wayyyy down there, away from downtown. It is nice because people can tailgate, which is like a great anthropological discovery for someone from a city whose stadium is right downtown. You can come early? And cook burgers? And drink beer? And you don't have do it at a bar? Fascinating! 

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the games feel shorter when you watch them at the stadium. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that the fans are kept entertained, even in the lull between innings. Plus the Phanatic has an effing hot dog bazooka! Come the hell on! But seriously, even if you don't know a thing about baseball, you will not be bored.

The tickets are relatively cheap for a professional sporting event, although they have become more difficult to obtain since the Phillies won the world series. Prior to this season, I used to be able to get decent seats the same week of the game without using a reseller. This is just what happens when your team kicks some serious ass, I suppose.

Thank god they have decent beer here. Seriously. Brewerytown carries Victory on tap and Dogfish Head in bottles. Since Prima Pils is my favorite pilsner, that makes me first a happy lady... then a drunk lady, despite the $7 price tag.

In addition to real beer, there is real food! There are even vegetarian options other than fries and pretzels. At my last game, I tried a cheesesteak from Tony Luke's. It was bready, but certainly nowhere near the worst I've ever had. Someone caught a ball about 10 seats down from me and THANK GOD the camera did not pull out enough to catch me scarfing that thing down. My dignity is still intact for the moment. 

Finally, I have read a few reviews that say Phillies fans are violent assholes, but I have to disagree. Passionate? Definitely. Are there a few bad seeds? Of course, there always are. Believe me, I come from drunken, violent, asshole fan MECCA. If there is anything I am an expert in, it is perhaps this topic. If you have an issue, there are ushers all over the place and it is made clear that they take complaints seriously.","Text1: I love Sephora, I really do.

Definitely worth it, and I'd love to bring a group of friends or my family here sometime--the atmosphere and menu selections are great for all!","It's nice to know that there's a Ben and Jerry's at least somewhere in Philly proper, better yet a few blocks away from where I work.  I stopped in one day, overheated after a grueling 6 hours of passing out flyers on the street and in need of something cold, refreshing, and most likely chocolaty.  I settled on the Half-Baked frozen yogurt, and I was quite satisfied with my choice.  Having loved Phish Food ice cream since I was a youngin', it was hard to choose, but I figured I can always go back and try a new flavor each time.

0,"Bowl & Roll is one of the better spots in the Nashville Farmers Market! They make rice bowls and rolls. A number of toppings are available including veggies, kimchi, and bulgogi. They're popular, so there's occasionally a line (esp. at lunchtime on Friday), but it is one of the better places in the market.","We've been to a number of Phillies games over the year and really like this ballpark. We've sat all over this park and we've never had a bad seat. Sure lower levels are better, but even up in the 400 level isn't that bad. We really enjoy sitting in the Hall of Fame club and of course the suites, but I only go to these areas when I get free tickets!

The kids love coming here as well. The Phanatic is a fun mascot to watch and there is a great kids play area all decked out with the Philly Phanatic. This fun zone has slides and tunnels to keep the kids occupied. It can and does get pretty crazy in there with all of the kids and it's pretty easy to lose your kids in all of those tunnels. There is only one way in and out of this place, so I usually park by butt by this area and make sure they don't get out. There are plenty of workers in the area and I'm sure they are making sure kids aren't walking out by themselves as well.

Plenty of food and drink options throughout the park and even places geared for kids where you can get them milk and child size portions. Plenty of shopping areas throughout the park as well. My kids always want to stop in and buy something, so I'm not sure if I really consider this a good thing or not!

While we always do have a good time, I will say it can be pretty expensive. You start off with $15 to park, then factor in tickets, food, drinks, possible souvenirs, and the next thing you know, you've dropped several hundred bucks! Given the way the Phillies are playing this year, it's a bit frustrating. Getting out of this place is usually a royal pain in the you know what as well! Would definitely recommend going to one of their fireworks games in July--they really do put on a spectacular fireworks show. We've been going for years now.","Text1: Bowl & Roll is one of the better spots in the Nashville Farmers Market! They make rice bowls and rolls.

Next, we had the tuna carpaccio w/ fried shrimp chips, which was phenomenal!  By far the best thing we've had there. We finished with the burger with house fries. These fries are far superior to their truffle parm fries. Perfectly salty and crispy.  Burger was simple, greasy, cheesy, and deliciously fantastic. mmmm beef...

But most of the time, I just want to choose food that tastes good from a menu with reasonable variety and prices. Marathon is my go-to spot for that kind of meal - especially for brunch! 

Offerings at Marathon are pretty basic. You've got burgers, you've got sandwiches, you've got salads. At brunch you've got French toast and eggs Benedict and omelets.

Some people might look down on Marathon and their basic offerings and chain status. I know, I live in a city with great food offerings, why spend my time and money here? Because I don't always need my mind blown, sometimes I just want a brisket sandwich (delish) and a side of French fries, done well, without a side of pretension.

1,"I tried Commonwealth Kitchen this evening for the first time, and I will say I was very impressed. 

First of all, I am so pleased to see a place like this in my neighborhood. I think it's the perfect addition. The dining area is really cool looking and the whole place is incredibly clean. 

I had the Holmesburger and Hubby had the CW Special. We were both pretty blown away by our burgers. They had a ton of flavor and all the toppings were really balanced. We also shared an order of poutine and it was fantastic! I can't even describe how happy I am to be able to finally get poutine in my neighborhood. This is definitely the beginning of a long, prosperous relationship. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, CK! You guys are the real deal.","Roger Wilco has made huge improvements to their store over the last year or so. I like that they have really bumped up their craft beer selection. It really is very competitive with other specialty stores and the prices are reasonable. This brings me here more often than I would normally come. I also like their discounted and clearance wines. It's always fun to take some time to dig through everything and see what gems I can find. Some of them are priced as low as $2.99/bottle! They also have a new growler program that I have not tried yet, but I am definitely looking forward to it!

My only qualms about this place are that it's difficult to find help in the store, and the employees are not as knowledgeable as I'd like them to be. I think all of the employees in the store could stand to be a little more available, helpful and pleasant. I am a paying customer after all. Also, the lines are always very long and the amount of registers open is lacking. 

I think Roger Wilco is well on its way to becoming a much better store. Just a few personnel tweaks and it will be my favorite place to shop for beer, wine and liquor.","Text1: I tried Commonwealth Kitchen this evening for the first time, and I will say I was very impressed.

I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !!","This place was recently changed to Brick House, and I ordered some take out pizza as I wanted to see what they were like.  The dough was rolled though a machine and not hand tossed, but the pizza tasted quite good.  It was a nice thin crust and crisp.  The staff as they were not busy at all were able to accommodate my request for a topping not on the menu (meatball), but you could tell they were not homemade.  Also asked for 1/2 broccoli which was skimped on.  The main restaurant was nice and large with lots of TVs to watch the game.

I bet this would be a good place to hang for some beers, but I don't know about food.  Pizza was good!","Text1: My friends at work (connoisseurs of good food in the St. Louis area) introduced me to yet another very nice restaurant and that's Brio's!! I like everything about it - starting from the complimentary bread and chips to the bruschetta, pasta and salads !! Beautiful place.. The service adds to the charm !! 

 Text2: This place was recently changed to Brick House, and I ordered some take out pizza as I wanted to see what they were like.  The dough was rolled though a machine and not hand tossed, but the pizza tasted quite good.  It was a nice thin crust and crisp.  The staff as they were not busy at all were able to accommodate my request for a topping not on the menu (meatball), but you could tell they were not homemade.

Not yuppified at all.

Service is minimal but I am usually able to find the dog-related supplies I need right away.","Oh Jones. Jones markets itself as a diner. Actually, it's a modern throwback to everything retro. The menu is made up of comfort favorites like mac n cheese, meatloaf, and crab cakes. The atmosphere reflects the menu with soft wood floors, teal tables, and night lights next to your table. They even have a fireplace if crab cakes weren't comforting enough. The wait staff are adorned in Modern Amusement(esque) clothes, and relaxed and outgoing, while maintaining the Starr standard you expect.","Text1: It's a chain and it has what I need.

Their steaks are divine, and who doesn't love live music on the weekends?","My girlfriend and I stopped in here last night, expecting the normal Reginelli's awesomeness. The food was fine, but this location has greatly changed since the last time I've been. I normally go to the State St Reginelli's, but since moving further downtown this location is more convenient to me.
We should have left the moment we went to go sit near the window and there was a SWARM of flies near the table. Blech. We decided to sit in a booth, which was still dirty from the last customers, but we didn't have much of a choice since most of the tables were either dirty, still had plates on them, or were occupied.
Another thing I noticed was that this location was very dark. Maybe I hadn't noticed it before because I had only come during the day? I don't know. At this point, my GF and I had already sat down and ordered our drinks so we decided to stay, but we felt very uncomfortable.
The combination of the darkness, dirtiness, and flies everywhere made me scarf down my pizza just so we could get the hell out of there. Like I said, our food was fine, but next time I am craving Reginelli's I will make sure to go to the State St location even if they chronically mess up my take out orders, they always get it right when I dine in.","Text1: One of my favorite places in Tampa!

We ordered the white mushroom pizza which I really enjoyed, even though I'm usually not a fan of white pizza.  The red pie we ordered consisted of garlic sausage and caramelized onions.  It was decent, but the white pizza won my heart.

The place could benefit from better customer service if you're going to screw up. The burger is nothing to brag about when you still have Shake Shack and other restaurants who could build a burger and still treat you like a paying customer.","Text1: We decided to give Kermit's a try, despite some of the negative reviews on here, as I find it difficult to trust people who don't know the difference between there/their/they're and to/too/two.

1,"If you're looking for a unique gift for someone this is a great place to try.  Third Degree has a variety of hand blown glass pieces made by several St Louis Artists. Ornaments, vases, bowls, glasses, and many other things that you decide you must have as soon as you see them out. The artists constantly make a variety of different pieces so if you don't see something you like the first time you go, come back another time.  There are always new pieces that might just pique your interest.

Also, if you're ever looking for something to do on a Friday evening, you should stop by the factory.  (Just make sure it's the Third Friday of the month). Check out their amazing open house (there is a link for them under Yelp Events if you're curious). You'll get to see demonstrations of the artists' work as well as look at all the new things they have made in the past month. While you are at it, you can also sign up for one of their workshops on making ornaments, beads, or paperweights - take home a little souvenir of your experience. Just a heads up, you may want to dress in layers. The hot shop may occasionally get extremely hot - I have found a few times in the summer I can't even sit there in jeans. 

I've heard the factory is a great place for events and venues, but did you also know they have glassblowing lessons?  That's right, you can learn how to make those one of a kind creations you see them selling.  Well, sort of learn... It takes a lifetime to master, but you would really be impressed with how much better you can get by the end of a semester. I took a series of glassblowing classes here through Wash U and loved it! Jon was my amazing instructor, and I highly recommend any of his classes. I am sure the other instructors are great too, but if I took another series here, I'd make sure Jon taught them. Glassblowing is a lot tougher than these masters make it appear. I can't tell you how many times I have messed up, but Jon really makes every student feel comfortable.  One thing I truly appreciate is his patience and flexibility. As beginners, it is very difficult to be able to deviate from your original plan, especially when something severely goes wrong and you cannot continue how you had intended.  Anytime a piece didn't come out quite right, Jon had an incredible amount of patience, foresight, and ingenuity to help us turn them into masterpieces we would love. (I am using the term masterpiece very very loosely here.  But if you compared the original to the final work, you'd understand why)  Examples? Lopsided, unusable cups into beautiful, decorative wavy bowls. Fat, overweight ornaments into delicate, impressive vases.  Destroyed, impractical bowls into useful paperweights.   My favorite part of the class?  Getting my own collection of handblown glass pieces that I made with my blood, sweat, and tears.  I highly recommend taking some classes here - who knows, you may find a new hobby!","I walked by this place and the first thing they tried to do was convince me to get a pedicure by insulting my feet.  It had been a month or so and I figured why not, so I decided to give this place a chance anyway.... bad idea.

Although they did a decent job of painting my nails, I did not really like the service.  The lady I was with tried to keep adding additional services to my bill (which I really did not mind because she only tried a couple of times).  However, she did inform me I was also in dire need of a pedicure and an eyebrow wax.  (I had just gotten my eyebrows threaded two days before, so I'm sure she wasn't trying to do me a favor).

The lady I had took her time and did everything well.  However, their attitude and service made me feel uncomfortable.  The entire time, she talked to her colleague in another language I could not understand.

If you have a little bit of time, though, and have some thoughts on how you might be able to organize a section of your kitchen or bedroom or basement or whatnot, they have some really good ideas and resources. 

If you don't have a game plan/list, though, you can get really overwhelmed with the walls of stuff and want to high tail it out of there, IMHO.

0,"Delicia definitely, without a doubt, deserves a 5 out of 5. It's a Nuevo Latino cuisine which basically means a little bit of above/everything since it has some Cuban, Mexican, Argentine, Peruvian, etc flair to the dishes. 

The ambiance was inviting. It reminds me of restaurants that I will go to in LA. Dark mood lighting, exposed wood beams, huge bar, Latin music playing...whoever designed the place deserves a pat in the back. 

The food was amazing. We ordered tostones con longaniza and empanadas as appetizers, beef with chimichurri and paella for the main entree. Then for dessert, we settled on a flan. They were all delicious.

We'll definitely go back to this place. Sunday supper is the perfect time since there's no wait time.","I am not a brown liquor person.... That said my husband LOVES it.  We decided to come here before heading to a concert at XPN.  When greeted at the door we were escorted to the bar where there was ample seating.  

The bartender was SUPER busy when we sat but immediately greeted us and said he would be with us shortly.  It was obvious that he was weeded with drinks so we patiently waited.  Once he finished up he gave us his full attention.  His name was Dave. :) Dave told us about specials and different bourbons and drink concoctions.  While I made a face at the brown liquor he immediately said HOLD UP... He was certain that I would like something!  My husband ordered a Manhattan first and I a vodka tonic.  Dave insisted that I tried some citrusy brown liquor drink... I'll admit, it was ok but still not for me.  He wasn't having it... on our second drink my husband had a Old Fashioned and i again had the vodka tonic.. Dave thought I was going to be a changed woman and order a brown liquor drink! So he tried again... this time with a mini old fashioned for me. UGH! Still no go.. I really wanted to like it but at this time my palate has not ""matured"" enough to enjoy it. :) 

While our bar experience was great with the drinks and stellar service I would be remiss if I didn't mention the food.  We ate the following:

Hummus - OMG the bacon flavor totally nailed it!
Roasted Root Veggies - very flavorful but a bit over the top with the bacon flavor
Mustard Green Salad - Super yummy, the vinaigrette was perfect with the spicy greens
Shrimp & Grits - DELISH tender shrimp 
Collards - mmm vinegary tangy yum
Hot Chicken - O.M.G. this shit was HOT but oh so good!! It wasn't a lasting heat as I was afraid of.. it was oh so good!

One of the best things about this place is the Coke dispenser - you can get just about any flavor of soda you can imagine. I (like Sarah) found the front counter help, not so helpful - No Hello or Welcome, It appears that you have to interact with them first before you can get someone to talk to you.","Tryst is a beautiful bar. Beach Drive needed something like it and especially a place that stays open until 3. I went on a Thursday night.  The place is beautifully appointed and very upscale. 

Amazing beer cooler with an incredible wide and varied selection.  Cocktails were well thought out when they created the menu. I had 2 very nice cocktails with muddled fruits and nice ingredients.  Steep cocktail price of $10 so it keeps you more in check than I prefer. 

We ordered 1 salad and 2 sharing tapas.  We had the Beef Carpaccio and the Eggplant Caprese.  Came in for dinner and at $15-17 per sharing tapa, I expected to be full. We walked out still hungry. With that said, food was very delicious and fresh. Nice wait staff from what we encountered.  

I will come back but not when I want a big dinner.  I think the place will be great for drinks when the weather starts turning for ""fall"" and we can sit outside.  Nice option to have that in St. Pete. 

Food wise tasty but more for a small (and expensive) bite. 

We did not encounter it being loud like Michael stated on a Thursday.

2 drinks, 2 apps, 1 salad - $70.00 before tip 

Overall - could be a romantic place for a ""tryst"" or great for a girl's night to catch up.",no
1,"For five-star bar food, great drink specials, and amazing service, Tabu is my go-to.  Last night was no exception when a friend and I split the Sriracha-garlic wings, which were $10 for 20 pieces!  Always a fine selection of drafts and of course every absolut flavor you can imagine.",This place has good cheesesteaks and a big menu.  Their pizza is also pretty decent.  They have a huge vegetarian/vegan menu with lots of good options.  Their large cheesesteaks are twice the size of most cheesesteaks so I usually only order the small one.  I've gotten pretty good service from the people there and it's great for a cheap and quick meal.,"Text1: For five-star bar food, great drink specials, and amazing service, Tabu is my go-to.

0,"While Han in Olde City is an eccentric, bossy, know-it-all kinda host. Catherina in University City is the most friendly, welcoming hostess you could find in any restaurants. Han Dynasty in UCity is definitely better than the original since it's a lot loftier with free parking, a nice bar area, a higher end venue altogether. It always have space to accommodate a large party like my friends and I. The staff here is way more professional. Instead of giving off that ""you're lucky to dine here"" vibe, they give you a sense that they really want you to be there. 

My favorite dish is still the double cook fish, the sesame noodle, beef and tripe in chili oil and pork belly in garlic sauce, but they have an UCity specific special menu with special items. During Chinese new year, they had a special special menu with stir-fried razor clams shaped like a peacock that was superb. Fried Taiwanese sausage is sweet and unlike the traditional Chinese sausages I had. Three cup chicken is also sweet little chunks of delights.

With such a welcoming crew, no wonder Han Dynasty is expanding and opening up more and more stores catering to people who wants to add more spice in their life. One of them just happens to be Jose Garces. I spotted him and his family dining the other night and I was star struck only to be too chicken s#*t and too polite to disrupt a family dinner to get my pictures taken with him. But if the Iron Chef comes here for his kick, it must be good, right?","GREAT mojitos.  Food is ok, this place has the best location for down town Reno....

Price is good, parking is limited but go to 41st street where you will almost always get a spot, service is great and the menu is terrific.","I had to schedule through Safelite AutoGlass via my Geico insurance but it was not an issue. It was seamless as I was able to complete the entire claim and scheduling process online without a single telephone call and ON A SUNDAY!!

0,"Bummer of an experience. The salad was uninspiring and the lamb was overdone and paired with mashed potatoes that were drowned in a salty gravy that reminded me of my mom's pot roast, not French fare. I had to choke it down.

I knew I was in for a poor experience when the bread came out soft and yellow, covered in salt and paired with...butter! I thought it was a wedge of cheese. Duh was I wrong. Americans...sigh.

I guess I'm doomed to lame bread until I can return to France again.

I will not be returning.","I live down the block from Kelly's Kitchen and sadly the strip mall location really didn't make it like an appealing place to have breakfast. Thankfully my Yelp app compared it to my ALL TIME favorite bfast spot - Old Croydon Cafe - so I decided to give it a shot. Overall, a solid old school diner experience. 

The inside of the place is a lot more modern than I expected, also much more spacious. It has plenty of seating room for parties mostly of 4 and singles at the bar top. Our server was very friendly and came promptly giving us the daily specials. The prices are great for the amount of food you get, especially during the week! 

I decided to order the Bensalem Special - 1 pancake, 1 french toast, 1 sausage, homefries, bacon, AND two eggs over easy - ALL of this only $8.50! Needless to say I got through half and was STUFFED. You can easily share this plate with one other person. As for the pancake, it was very regular, nothing notable. The homefries were fancy, I love when places add some spice. They also had a huge list of omlettes that I would like to try.

Our server was friendly and kept our coffee cups full - which I love. I even asked for a spoonful  of the gravy for future ordering reference and she brought out a small bowl and it was delicious. I would definitely come back and make sure to bring CASH!","Text1: Bummer of an experience.

Soups, salads, and sandwiches! Perfect spot for a quick lunch. Place looks clean and well kept. Menu has plenty of choices for anyone.

I ordered broccoli and cheddar soup with a half croissant chicken sandwich. The soup was oh so delicious! The croissant was good too, but it felt like it was missing something bc it was a lil bit on the drier side. The size they give you for lunch is perfect! Not so heavy that you are returning to work and wanna pass out. lol. Next time I go, I will get a salad. So many salads were ordered while I was eating and they all looked soooooo delicious!

Another plus...they take level up. If you don't have level up yet, go there, download the app, and scan the code to get $5 off! :-)","Sweet almond pretzel is the only way to go.

1,"Went with my whole family for an early dinner.  My mom and brother live close to Lansdale, so that was a major factor in our choosing to drive out that far.  Also, my teenage daughter is named Nadia.

Crab dumplings and chix sate' were both quite good, as were the corn/shrimp fritters.  All were decent sized servings, so a single app is good for two normal eaters.

Everyone who ordered Pad Thai enjoyed their versions (lots of peanuts) and the Madras curry my son ordered passed his test.  I ordered the Green Curry w/ beef (as the spiciest of entree's) and asked for it extra spicy and it was.  Service was polite and friendly but not cloying.

I would probably not make an hour's drive especially to go there, but if I were in the area, I would certainly go back.  I would like to try some of the more exotic chef's specials like duck, alligator and lamb.  They could gain another star.","The experience is seriously hampered by the limited seating. If you need to sit next to an overweight person (which would seem to describe ALL their regulars) you will pretty much need to turn sideways.

The Red Beans and Rice were superb.  Lots of Andouille, and a perfect ration of rice to beans and gravy.  Also has the crispy mac and cheese (which the sign said contained crawfish, but was apparently out of date.  They change the dish every week, and don;t seem to care to update the simple computer-printed sign.   Food is prepped to order and arrives piping hot.  Mac and cheese was lightly breaded and DEEP FRIED (which might explain the girth of the regulars.) 

In all, very authentic NOLA-style cuisine, and friendly and efficient service.  It would have been more pleasant with a table and without a dozen people behind us eyeing our seats.","Text1: Went with my whole family for an early dinner.

1,I am a lover of craft beer and I came to Perennial for the first time during a Yoga Buzz event actually where we had a private yoga class in their tasting room then were treated to a beer tasting afterwards. They have a small tasting room with several tables and lots of board games that would make for a great weekend afternoon with friends. They also have a lot of bar space to sit and have a beer and geek out with the bartenders. Before our tasting we were educated in the different varietals they had on tap including their ingredients and tasting notes. I tried both of their saisons they had on tap which were pretty flavorful but not my favorite. I loved their darkness chocolate orange stout which was right on line with some of my favorite stouts. Their beer is more pricey than the other local breweries in town but they also brew it in smaller batches. Will definitely be back!,I haven't actually stayed at this hotel so the review I'm writing is based on special events I have attended alone. I'm always excited when an event I'm attending is hosted at the Union Station Hotel. It is in my opinion one of the most beautiful locations in town. Their ballrooms are spacious and great to host big tasting events such as Iron Fork I've attended many times. What is really impressive about this hotel is the Grand Hall with the wonderful Christmas light show and beautiful bar. I attended the Yelp Winter Wonderland in this location tonight which was illuminated by beautiful Christmas tree and lights in addition to their famous light show. The bar would be impressive for any date night when you're wanting a unique cocktail experience.

Whisk uses local fruit and adjust the popsicle offerings based on what is available. The owners are extremely nice! I can't speak for any of the other products as I only had the popsicle.

1,"I should preface that my review on Bridgestone Arena is solely based on it being a music venue. Haven't been to a Preds game yet but the year is still young!

1,"I got to sample from a bunch of different places and I noticed two things, well, three things that were sort of strange/could be changed. It felt like there was an overwhelming number of sandwiches to try. While I like sandwiches they're very filling very fast. The second thing - it seemed like there was a lot of pork. Again, I love pork and all but I would have loved some exciting non-pork options. And last criticism - how am I supposed to try every truck if the portions are so big? I would have killed for half-size things at an event like this so everyone could have gotten my business. All in all it's a really nice event though and I wouldn't hesitate to go to another one.","Ok, I stopped in for the first time yesterday. I didn't know what to expect, but I always saw it on the corner and figured why not. Our waitress was as sweet as could be, and the staff seemed to have a lot of fun working there. The majority of the menu was seafood with a few options if seafood isn't your thing. We got a half rack of ribs, 1/2 lb peel and eat shrimp, 2 side Ceasars, some fries, a cocktail, a non-alcoholic drink, and a slice of key lime pie for $33. I'm not sure how anyone could call it pricey. The food was great for the kind of place this is, and I totally recommend the key lime pie. Like another reviewer said, there are dollar bills covering everything. They even have a couple on the ceiling. They also have paper towels on rolls above each table (they hang on something that looks like a modified wire clothes hanger). Really cool atmosphere, and better than many of the other little places along Gulf.","Text1: I got to sample from a bunch of different places and I noticed two things, well, three things that were sort of strange/could be changed.

1,"Yeah!! Frozen yogurt on Main St!!! So I'm super excited to see this place and hope it doesn't fall victim to the Manayunk curse- it's hard to survive on Main St! I tried both the original and acai pomegranate (which came highly recommended by the girl behind the counter). Both were delicious but not quite right. Basically they both had a slightly icey texture but quickly melted. Does that make any sense? It just wasn't as smooth and creamy as other fro-yo places I've tried. I topped both with kiwi and mango. The kiwi could have been much more ripe, but the mango was perfect! The yogurt was tasty irregardless, but was a deliciously soupy mix by the time I reached my car a few minutes later. I'll gladly be back for more (like i said its tasty) and hope the yogurt consistency is better my second time around.","Really the sushi isn't so bad. Although they seem to drench everything in spicy sauce, many of the rolls were quite tasty. The real disappointment (and the reason for the 3) was the Pork Tonkatsu. It was god awful! The pork was a soggy mess with a sad sad egg placed on top. I love Tonkatsu for the cripsy tempura coating on the pork, but here it was just a soggy mess. Don't think I'll return for any sort of entree item, but if you like your sushi with a bit of sauce, than this is the place for you.","Text1: Yeah!! Frozen yogurt on Main St!!!

1,"I've kind of got a food crush on Bailey's. 

    After running the Tap 'N' Run 4K my friends and I were, well, drunk. And what do you need after a good beer run? A burger. So we decided this was as good a time as any to give Bailey's Range our undivided, starving attention. 
   When we walked in we were absolutely charmed by the atmosphere. The open space is great--big open windows, and the second story catwalk above that you can dine at is pretty awesome as well. We sat at the long main dining table by the kitchen area so we got to watch the chefs and admire their expansive collection of windows. I'm a fan of that sort of thing. 
       Our waitress dropped off our little mason jars full of water and left us two jugs (smart cookie!). A little bit after, she returned to take our order and I decided to try the Sweet Smoke Burger with a small fry and the Hot/Sweet sauce. The Sweet Smoke comes with an onion ring...so that's where I was at, a greasy, delicious concoction that I could only justify at this point in time. When my fries came, I tried the Hot/Sweet sauce but I was not a fan at all. One of my friends enjoyed it but it was a little too honey mustard yet spiced for me...just not sweeping my tastebuds off their feet. So I asked for BBQ and she promptly brought me a different mini-jar full. 
    Besides that mishap, my burger and fries were pretty freakin' good. The service was good and she always came around to check on us after a bit (it wasn't all too busy so she could've came after serving us to ask how everything was), but all in all a great first experience at Bailey's. 

    Next time I am determined to try a shake....and leave my leopard print tights and tutu at home.","More than meets the eye, this restaurant is everything I could want in an Italian cafe. When you walk in there is a bar area (deceptive because it is small, but it has a chalkboard menu which immediately made me love it). We had a reservation for my friends birthday so a host walked us through an arch way to a dining area, which was bustling with people eating (and there was another smaller dining room in the back!) It is family run with a few family photos on display around the dining space. The atmosphere is welcoming and filled with the smell of delicious food.

    Our waitress was very kind and attentive but not over bearing, always refilling our glasses and checking to make sure we enjoyed our dishes. We ordered calamari to start and it came out with a dijon horseradish sauce, perfectly breaded and fried calamari (very tender and amazingly tangy and sweet with some lemon sauce) over a bed of spinach which was a nice touch. 

     I then ordered the Linguine Dolano as a half order as my friends ordered the baked lasagna and the Cavatelli Broccoli. The half order was just the right size, still a decent portion and at a great price (mine was only $6). My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. 

        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a ""sample platter"" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business.

0,This place is everything you imagined. I can't believe I didn't submit my review. At the time I ate meat and I got miso lamb ramen. Omg!!! It was amazing. All those flavored bursting in your mouth. The wait wasn't bad at all. It's clean and friendly. I called ahead and ordered for take out and it was enjoyable.,"Great place to try if you are looking for a nice romantic place to dine in Nashville. The second floor dining area offers a great view of Nashville skyline in the evening. Food and service was excellent, and surprisingly not very expensive either (well maybe the drinks are, but not the food). The place is located in Gulch, a nice/hip area of somewhat downtown Nashville, with boutique shops and other restaurants, and parking is still relatively cheap.","Text1: This place is everything you imagined.

1,"I had a lot of expectations going into Milktooth based on the reviews I had been reading. I was excited because the concept of a restaurant with an upscale coffee bar was reminiscent of a restaurant (Cafe Medina) that I like to go to in my hometown of Vancouver. I also really liked that they serve several different beans from different roasters.

After eating at Milktooth, I must say that the food was just okay, and the iced coffee that I had was meh, while the regular drip was okay. I don't know if it was quite worth the 45 minute wait. I think my experience was dampened by the flies that kept flying into me, on my food, and drinking from my water glass. At one point, the waitress had come by to ask if everything was okay while a was holding my fork with a fly standing right on it.

I started with an iced vietnamese coffee. I was disappointed by it because it was very weak and watery. The floral flavor of the beans was there, it was the right type of beans and roast, but it was just too weak. I knew this was going to happen because when I was observing the coffee being made, the beans were not packed down enough to allow for the water to steep long enough and have a slower drip. Instead, the water was dripping down too fast into the glass, much like a typical pour over. This process resulted in a coffee whose color was more of an orange than an almost black brown, so when it was actually mixed with the condensed milk, it was almost a vanilla/peach color instead of medium coffee color. This may have been intentional on their part, to get drinks and orders through as quick as possible, but it was probably the worst iced vietnamese coffee I've ever had. It made it the worst because I was expecting my thick, full-bodied, acidic coffee with the richness of the condensed milk and the cooling effect of the ice.

For the food, we had the strawberry shortcake donut holes with whipped goat cheese. This was my favorite, it was definitely good. It made me more open to the idea of ordering more food after my main meal just because I wanted to try more stuff.  However, after I had my okonomiyaki (a favorite treat that I love to eat), and my partner had her Huevos, we did not want to order any more food. Not because we were full, but because we were underwhelmed and feeling like the food we got was overpriced for the quality.  My okonomiyaki was bland. It was missing something. The combination of egg, broken ramen noodles, and calamari really made it bland. I was expecting the bacon to add some flavor, and of course the okonomiyaki sauce and the japanese mayo, but because of the way the bacon was cooked, the full flavor of the bacon did not come through and added to the bland, somewhat fatty taste of the okonomiyaki. Perhaps the okonomiyaki would have benefitted from stronger green onions and some bonito.  As for the Huevos, I can't say much, except my partner commented that it would not have tasted like anything without the salmon, but something about the salmon was actually putting her off it. My partner really liked her mimosa though and said it's the best she's had in a while.

So overall? My experience was okay, a bit underwhelming and based on the food that I received, I thought it was a bit overpriced. Will I come back? I will probably come back for the drinks, and maybe try the tea wings and other pastries.","Why have I not eaten here sooner? Oh yeah, cause the last couple of times I did make it over, I chose that awkward time that they were closed.

Anyway, move over Magasin, this place is so much better! Sure, it's not as trendy or stylish, it doesn't look half as busy, and the menu is not as extensive, but it's probably the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant I've been to on this side of the river. The prices may be slightly higher, but I guess gas and toll fees make up the difference.  Oh yeah, and helpful friendly service.

I had the Grilled Pork Bun and my girlfriend had the Grilled Beef Bun, we also ordered Egg Rolls. The portions for the Buns are large, except next time I would probably order the Egg Roll to go with the Bun, instead of a separate order, as the price actually comes out cheaper.

What's good about the Buns?  Well they add the usual that you should have in there, crushed peanuts, fried shallots, and perfect fish sauce, all three things that are missing from the Magasin Bun.  Oh, and of course, I do prefer the traditional iceberg lettuce.  OH wait, did I mention that they also give you a generous portion of meat, it's cut differently into slices, but it is a lot more than just 4 - 5 thicker slices of the grilled pork or beef you would get at other places.  The Eggs Rolls were also pretty standard and good, not rolled in so much wrapping that it's hard.

I'll definitely be coming back and I'll be getting the Pho next time.","Text1: I had a lot of expectations going into Milktooth based on the reviews I had been reading.

0,"I've never written a review while I was still in the restaurant until now...I just had a great breakfast and I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu! Being my first visit I went with the classic breakfast...eggs, bacon toast, potatoes, coffee and orange juice. It was classic on steroids! The potatoes just a little different, the juice Is freshly squeezed, the bacon just a little thicker than usual, the strawberry jam more flavorful than most...Is it OK to eat breakfast twice because I want more now. 

Friendly staff, good prices and quick service...breakfast nirvana!","I like you, Izumi, and here's why: aside from the fact that you have some really excellent, fresh fish, you also employ staff that can talk in great detail about the flavors of each dish.  As if that wasn't enough to win me over, you guys can cook up some amazing hot appetizers and entrees.  

We stopped here during Restaurant Week and naturally, the place was packed.  The host was so polite, though, and told us that while he wouldn't be able to provide us with a reservation for that night, he'd really love for us to come back and give them a chance.  I truly appreciated the fact that he didn't just brush us off because they were busy, so we knew we had to take him up on his word.  Izumi really delivered on their promise.

1,"Cal Taco is great for veggie burgers. I heard that the owner is brothers with the owner of the Habit and you can tell the similarities.

The fries are very similar if not identical to the Habit's. The size of the meal is huge and it definitely fills you up.

It comes with sprouts, tomato, onions, lettuce and some kind of sweet sauce with orange slices on the side. You also get the choice of regular bun, wheat bun or french bread--the french bread makes the sandwich quite a bit bigger.

I chose the Pumpkin Cheesecake... and it was very very good.... especially the FREE part,"I had an early lunch today on Christmas eve from work, so I thought...The Turnip Truck Urban Fare is not far from my office....so winner winner, chicken dinner...they were open..so I parked in the rain in their private parking lot ((( a real plus in the Gulch area)) and ran in..They have a salad bar, a hot bar with 5 different soups...fresh fruit and veggies on the bar. Also a deli section where they can cut the meat and cheeses fresh and make you sandwiches. 
They also have a variety of salads in the showcase and some pre-made sammies to choose from. I ordered my sandwich...whole wheat with Roast Beef and Provolone cheese with Chipotle mayo, lettuce tomatoes onions and cucumbers..I wish they had had some spinach or kale instead of the lettuce..but hey...it was all good!!!
While waiting for my food to be made to order, I perused the shelves and found a few other goodies I needed for my home kitchen...
my sandwich was ready so I went to the check out and paid for my treasures...
I would definitely go here again...next time some nice hot soup would hit the spot.

0,"Diamond in the rough. That's all that can be said about this chaat-catering, strangely delicious, unbelievably friendly environment. For the sake of full disclosure, my taste buds were certainly adjusting to chaat as I was at Mood. It's a strange sensation: the mixing of the hot veggies and meat, the cold yogurt, the crispy wonton shells - all of it crunched up in a bowl. 

Hasan, the owner and one of the friendliest faces in all of Philadelphia, explained every step of how he prepares and serves the food. Then, for dessert, he prepared a carrot and cream cheese dish, with hot, stewed carrots (naturally sweet) and homemade cheese. It was somehow similar to a pumpkin or sweet potato pastry. 

Like other reviewers's experience, I too was blown away by both Hasan's kindness and his restaurant. He remembers faces well, and will prepare you a different kind of dish every time you visit. He promised a different, hot rice and beans dish next time I came. He also assured my girlfriend and I that we would not have to pay if we didn't like the food. However, we loved the chaat and the dessert, and were more than happy to pay every cent (though he didn't charge us for the dessert). Can't wait to go back!","Gobi Manchurian in Amans is wayyyy better than here. The atmosphere sucks and I have the pleasure of waiting 50 minutes for my dosa's. Seems to be a hit and miss lately with their biryani that burned my tongue. Looks on Photos are deceiving.

I rather travel another 25 minutes to Devis or 10 minutes to mmmAmans.","Text1: Diamond in the rough.

1,"If you need to travel from Philly to anywhere else in the northeast corridor, 30th Street Station is where you need to be.  Do not get on a plane, do not get on a bus, and leave your car behind.  It will usually be cheaper, faster and more relaxing to ride those rails.

This magnificent train station reminds a girl what travel used to be like.  From the angel sculpture to the high windows to the old-school flip board showing the train times, this transit hub does the city proud - especially on the way into town.  The actual Amtrak platforms are kind of dark and dingey.  This makes it feel even more spectacular when you emerge into the architectural wonder above.  I can imagine someone making their first trip to this ""foreign"" town 100 years ago coming up those stairs and feeling pleased with their decision to visit.  30th St Stn is also where trains coming in across central PA need to switch over from diesel to electric engines, and this transition goes quickly and smoothly 99% of the time.

The amenities are sufficient, with lots of options for food and drinks at most hours that trains are running.  The bathrooms are reasonably clean for what they are - public transportation bathrooms, though some of the stalls are tiny.  These problems seems small when you can get an excellent shoe shine, a properly made latte and a bouquet flowers while you wait for your train.

The connections to local rail services (MFL and Regional Rail) are easy to utilize, but could be a little more clearly marked.  Furthermore, I am pretty sure that SEPTA gives the 30th St Stn assignment as a prize to their least grumpy representatives.","I have been trying to find a solid ""nice"" pizza place in Philly for years; after my first trip to Rocchino's, I'm still  searching.

I came with my husband for a late-ish pizza dinner on a recent blustery Saturday night around 9:30.  A few tables were occupied, and we were pleasantly greeted at the door and seated immediately.  The decor was pleasant, if unremarkable, with the pizza oven serving as a focal point towards the back.  The chairs were comfortable and, aside from a slight draft and strange lack of other customers, it was a nice place to be.

A waitress gave us menus, took drink orders and explained how they do their food ""tapas style"" so things come out as they're ready.  This was my first source of aggravation, as they are a pizza/Italian restaurant.  The current restaurant trend of using ""tapas style"" as code for ""we can't coordinate our kitchen well enough to serve your meals together"" needs to stop.

We ordered two pizzas, the margherita and the sausage/broccoli rabe, which were thankfully brought out at the same time.  To open with the positive, I will say the crust on these pizzas was spot on - crispy, slightly chewy, with just a few charred spots from the oven.  However, aside from the crust, both pizzas were disappointing. They were very bland and required generous applications of red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese and (a first for me with pizza) salt to taste like anything.  Yes, my pizza with sausage needed more salt.  The pizzas are ~12"", and should be viewed as ""personal sized"".  I had a few slices left from mine, while husband finished his.

Nothing was openly bad about our experience and, had we not spent $90 on two pizzas and a few glasses of wine, they might have gotten 3 stars.  If they stay in business for another few months, I will assume things may have improved and would consider trying them again.  In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy NYPD Pizza take-out, and keep hoping that one day I might show up to Zavino when they have less than a 40 minute wait.","Text1: If you need to travel from Philly to anywhere else in the northeast corridor, 30th Street Station is where you need to be.

1,"Does this place have some of the best donuts in the world? If they don't I am shocked.  I had a donut in here that I can only discribe as outstanding. Fantastic, fabulous. The second one I had was just Meh..... I was kind of disappointed. I have been here several times and I cannot seem to get a consistent product. A donut that is fresh and yummy one day is dry and bland another. 

The service moves at a moderate pace. The first visit, the place was packed and it took a while. The second time, the place was empty and the service took even longer. They were almost out of coffee and gave us three half filled cups of warm coffee. It tasted old. If you have brew, right on your sign, shouldn't you have fresh coffee at all times? Just saying.

I have tried the sliders, and they are very tasty with quality ingredients, but they are a bit pricey.  This place is often a madhouse with horrible parking, but I continue to go back. If you are ever walking down Magazine and want a little break, try it out.","If you are not familiar with TJ Maxx, they sell high end and designer items at a discount.  Usually it is a pretty decent discount, although they can be a bit steep.  I have a special affinity for the health and beauty aids section as I love the higher end shampoos and soaps.  

The lotions and bubble baths are occasionally more than you would pay for them at Macy's and Dillard's so watch out. 
 
There is a modicum of organization at TJ Maxx but just barely. Most of the time, I just wander around the store looking through all sizes and departments as there is something about this place that prevents things from remaining in the proper sections. 

I have to fight the urge to reorganize everything. 

If you are interested there is a 30 day layaway.  There are lots of things you can't put on layaway there so don't load up a whole buggy thinking you are about to put housewares and such on layaway. They will not let you. 

The employees all seem miserable. Even the manager has the ""Get out while you still can"" look. The computer voice at the registers directing you to a specific register are a little weird. ""Register 4 is now available, Please proceed to register 4.""

Turkey leg: Wow, I wanted to go pirate style and grab it and chow down. Great smoked flavor and skin, awesome taste in the actual turkey meat as well. Unfortunately I had to eat this with a fork and knife.

BBQ Pulled Pork / burnt ends (Wednesday Special): Solid, but not the best. Some burnt end parts were delicious, fatty, smokey, and soft. Some were very tough and couldn't eat.

0,"Gardening requires a lot of water - most of it in the form of perspiration.  If you want to sweat a little less you buy plants at a quality greenhouse.  True gardeners would rather poke a stick in their eye than buy plants at Home Depot or Lowes.  You may get a good price but you just don't get the quality.

Russell Gardens is a great family owned greenhouse.  Break out your GPS to get there as it's out in the boondocks.  These folks have a split personality.  There is the retail operation and 100 yards down the road with a separate parking lot is the wholesale site.  Why should you care?  Read on.

The retail operation is well run with hundreds of annuals and perennials.  Most of the plants are grown on site.  This is a big deal because your purchases are acclimated to this area and that makes them more likely to survive and thrive.  Prices are completive with other greenhouses.

So what about this wholesale operation?  Wouldn't it be great to get in there and pay wholesale prices?  Savvy gardeners know the secret!  The greater Philly area has dozens and dozens of gardening clubs and societies.   The Russell Gardens folks are smart and allow folks that are members of select clubs to visit the wholesale side and pay wholesale prices.  This is an entirely different world.  It is not as pretty as the retail side as this is where all the plants are grown.  You'll find yourself wandering along row after row of giant greenhouses.  The lovely wife and I visited yesterday as we are members of the Delaware Valley Water Garden Society (DVWGS).  We loaded up on quality plants at great prices.  

So if you are a serious gardener and like a great deal, find a club in your area has this relationship.  Most cubs only cost a few bucks to join and it can be well worth the investment.","Well, well, well...Cunningham Restaurant Group strikes again!  They are on fire and setting the rest of Indy on fire with them.  First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. ""This place would make a great business"" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.

Throw all of this together with the very warm welcome we received as well as the very attentive service, and we had a spectacular Livery experience.","Text1: Gardening requires a lot of water - most of it in the form of perspiration.  If you want to sweat a little less you buy plants at a quality greenhouse.  True gardeners would rather poke a stick in their eye than buy plants at Home Depot or Lowes.  You may get a good price but you just don't get the quality.

Russell Gardens is a great family owned greenhouse.  Break out your GPS to get there as it's out in the boondocks.  These folks have a split personality.  There is the retail operation and 100 yards down the road with a separate parking lot is the wholesale site.  Why should you care?  Read on.

The retail operation is well run with hundreds of annuals and perennials.  Most of the plants are grown on site.  This is a big deal because your purchases are acclimated to this area and that makes them more likely to survive and thrive.  Prices are completive with other greenhouses.

So what about this wholesale operation?  Wouldn't it be great to get in there and pay wholesale prices?  Savvy gardeners know the secret!  The greater Philly area has dozens and dozens of gardening clubs and societies.   The Russell Gardens folks are smart and allow folks that are members of select clubs to visit the wholesale side and pay wholesale prices.  This is an entirely different world.  It is not as pretty as the retail side as this is where all the plants are grown.  You'll find yourself wandering along row after row of giant greenhouses.  The lovely wife and I visited yesterday as we are members of the Delaware Valley Water Garden Society (DVWGS).  We loaded up on quality plants at great prices.  

So if you are a serious gardener and like a great deal, find a club in your area has this relationship.  Most cubs only cost a few bucks to join and it can be well worth the investment. 

 Text2: Well, well, well...Cunningham Restaurant Group strikes again!  They are on fire and setting the rest of Indy on fire with them.  First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. ""This place would make a great business"" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.

I got my toes done before I left for San Fran and they painted them bright pink! The nail polish has lasted without a chip or dent. They were quick to do the pedicure and they did a really good job. I also enjoyed the massage chairs they had, I probably could have sat in them all day! They also managed to squeeze me in for an eyebrow waxing at the last minute and both spa treatments ended up costing me $45 with tax and tip. A great del if you ask me! They also offer gel schalack nails, which I'm hoping to try in the near future!","Ordered take out, everything was warm, well cooked and I thought a decent serving amount. Very good, medium spice versus mild spice is noticeably different. The tandoori chicken wings were very tender and flavorful. Their paneer was dense, naan thin and a bit crisp. The palak paneer was thick with spinach. I liked the shahi paneer I've only found a buttery sweet creamy dish like this in one other restaurant.","Text1: I really enjoyed Sophie's Nails!

0,"Ok, I accidentally discovered this place on my way to the Tea Room but they were closed on a Monday. The place was big, no actual theme going on and lacked the cozy feel. 

I ordered the Chai Latte, it wasn't the powder kind so it actually tasted good. Is it my favorite? Well, no but it was a cold day, the price was good and the location was convenient. My friend ordered an egg and cheese on an English muffin and she said it was tasty. I think I would come back again but this place needs to be more inviting and warm. 

One thing I really disliked and I dislike this about other restaurants/cafe's is poor ventilation over the stove/ovens/toasters. I hate smelling like the food that you have prepared for me or other customers. Literally, my clothes smelled like food and I was nauseous the rest of the day. 

The staff/owner was really friendly and he seemed to really know his customers which is very important.","My brother-in-law and his soon to be wife took us out for dinner here mid-week. We met at 7pm on a Tuesday and had to wait a few minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant wasn't full. Not a big deal. The table we got was strange, though. It was a big round table in the middle of all the booths, and really close to the kitchen, so I could hear all the kitchen noise and see some of the action.

Our sever, Curt (I think), was really great. He was friendly, attentive, checked on us enough but not too much, joked around with my father-in-law. He was a fairly young guy, working in a Boston Pizza in the middle of the week, so I have to admit I was really surprised at how good he was. It was actually some of the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time.

All of our food was as ordered and come out in a timely manner. No problems there. It was Tuesday night and all wine was half off!

The only gross thing was that there was garbage and dirt all over the floor, under our table and everywhere. Napkins, crumbs, food remnants.

I thought the pizza would blow my socks off after reading the reviews. I got a standard 12"" cheese pizza + mushrooms for $7.95. It was OK. Allegros is definitely better. The sauce was thin, a bit sour for my taste, and definitely nothing special :/

Crazy fries- Crispy fries smothered with 8 oz. of fresh beef, Whiz, bacon, barbecue, hot sauce and ranch. Topped with shredded cheese. -- this was pretty good but the hot sauce/barbeque sauce overpowered and cheese whiz and bacon. I'd probably prefer their cheesy bacon ranch fries -- so I'll try that next time..

All in all, an OK college place. Delivery to USP campus amounted to $22.00 including tip.","Text1: Best fries ever! I am not a burger person so can't tell but everyone seems really enjoying it.

Modern. Will be coming back. Seems to be giving publix a run for their business.","Ok, I stopped in for the first time yesterday. I didn't know what to expect, but I always saw it on the corner and figured why not. Our waitress was as sweet as could be, and the staff seemed to have a lot of fun working there.

We got a half rack of ribs, 1/2 lb peel and eat shrimp, 2 side Ceasars, some fries, a cocktail, a non-alcoholic drink, and a slice of key lime pie for $33. I'm not sure how anyone could call it pricey. The food was great for the kind of place this is, and I totally recommend the key lime pie. Like another reviewer said, there are dollar bills covering everything. They even have a couple on the ceiling. They also have paper towels on rolls above each table (they hang on something that looks like a modified wire clothes hanger).

0,"The special Bui sauce.. hm.. tangy, spicy, it's a mixture of some not so common Asian flavor. Price is cheap, but flavor is just ok. Also it only opens rush hours, so if the doors are shut, it means shut. I tried meatballs and some steak sandwiches. They are okay. I think meatballs is little heavy with binders and hard to taste the meat. I can tell the sauce is definitely some jar brand.","I managed to find some great stocking stuffers here for Christmas!

I went with a 3 because this place is a little small. And this might seem silly, but it doesn't feel at fancy as I feel it should considering the higher prices. Also, while I will drink just about any kind of tea, what I really want is a strong chai or punch-you-in-the-face cinnamon. And I haven't been able to find that here.

0,"We stopped in on a whim on a busy Saturday night for a light bite of dinner.   Usually Italian is not the place for a light bite, but here they make it work very well.  The scene is kind of upscale/casual if there is such a thing.   The appearance is classy, but the place is loud and really has a kind of fun, neighborhood vibe.  If your neighborhood is Ladue, that is.  
We had the good fortune of sitting at the bar for a few minutes next to a talkative self-described barfly.  She was pretty darn thrilled to have a chance to walk us through the menu, and that's fine with us. Turns out she's a very regular who works next door I addition to being a great Giovanni's ambassador.  

Now we have been to Giovanni's on the Hill, but that was waaay more of a special occasion restaurant.  We were happy with the food there, but not so much the art museum hushed-tones ambience.  Somewhere between is their Il Bel Lago, so this restaurant is a nice addition to their lineup.  I think it's casual enough where it would work just about anywhere.  
We split a salad called Burrata al Pomodoro and had two small pastas; Casoncelli and cannelloni.  The large and small portions were perfect for us.  All three of these dishes were not just good, but were all pretty special.   A couple of warnings, though:  the Casoncelli has a very strong mushroom flavor and the small size cannelloni was small than a lot of tapas I've had, maybe half the size of my palm.   Again, though, the tastes were pretty fantastic.  

If Ladue wasn't over the river and through the woods, we might become barflies ourselves.","Great little independent coffee shop.  It can be a little tough to find (I always have to do a u-turn to get into it), but it is worth making the extra effort to visit this tiny gem. There is plenty of parking out front, and they also have a convenient drive-thru window.

It has become something of my Friday ritual to get coffee here before work, and exchange gossip with the two awesome women that work there in the mornings, Cece and Kelly.

Currently, I'm working my way through different flavored lattes. They have a ton of options to choose from when it comes to syrups, and I love that they have different combinations worked out for different seasons. So happy they have soy milk for those of us who need to stay away from lactose. All of your standard coffee cocktails are available: mochas, lattes, cappuccinos, etc. in hot, frozen, or over ice.

I would say that the baristas here are definitely coffee specialists. They actually time how long your espresso brews for, to make sure it's the right consistency and flavor.  Apparently, if it is not exact, the coffee will be bitter. And I have certainly had some bitter coffee from some of those big box store coffee shops (you know who you are), so I believe there is truth to this science.

0,"We were there on a weekday night. So the place was not crazily busy.  We picked up 4 plates from the belt and ordered other 4 from the menu. It was close to closing time so the chief wasn't going to add more plates on the circulation. The ordered dishes came out fast and fresh. The sushi and fried calamari all tasted good and they all matched their pictures shown on the menu. Our waiter did a good job serving us. He paid attentions and responded fast. The ambience was nice even in the middle of shopping mall. Our booth seats was comfortable. We tried 8 plates totally and the check was $35. Usually in a regular sushi restaurant, 35 only allowed us to have 2-3 different dishes or roll. The selections from the menu are huge, from fried rice, noodle to dessert. 
If everybody's new year resolution is to lose weight, eating smaller portion is the key. I don't mind paying less money for smaller , good quality food. It will be cool if Italian, Mexico, Mediterranean food, pizza, burger etc. all become small and fit in the small dishes that parade in front of the customers on a conveyor belt. Overall, this restaurant was better than I expected as a shopping mall food court place.","If you're in the area and like steak, go here. I was in Hyde Park and needed a place to eat for lunch. Happened upon this gem. I got the Peter Lawford (Petite Filet), and my partner got Frank Sinatra (Shrimp Cocktail). The filet was delicious. One of the best I've had. The portions were filling but small.  The sweet ending desserts were similar to that of Seasons 52, I believe, the cakes shots. Those were pretty good. 

Overall, definitely worth the time. Few people were inside for lunch (most were outside), so the noise level was pretty low. The price is a bit high, but if you're in the area, might as well.","Text1: We were there on a weekday night. So the place was not crazily busy.  We picked up 4 plates from the belt and ordered other 4 from the menu. It was close to closing time so the chief wasn't going to add more plates on the circulation. The ordered dishes came out fast and fresh. The sushi and fried calamari all tasted good and they all matched their pictures shown on the menu. Our waiter did a good job serving us. He paid attentions and responded fast. The ambience was nice even in the middle of shopping mall. Our booth seats was comfortable. We tried 8 plates totally and the check was $35. Usually in a regular sushi restaurant, 35 only allowed us to have 2-3 different dishes or roll. The selections from the menu are huge, from fried rice, noodle to dessert.

1,"Breakfast was swing and a miss for me.  I want to like this place so much, but despite being a diner with a huge focus on breakfast, I think they shine better at dinner.  Service was ok, nothing special, and kind of slow.  The quality of the food was average to slightly below average.  My hubby's grits were downright nasty. They were watery sludge.  

It's so close, reasonably priced, and I loved dinner the one time I went to a different location.  I'll be back to try them for dinner.  Fingers crossed!","I was so pleased with breakfast here. I am not a big breakfast person, so it takes a lot to wow me.  I was wowed.  At our server's suggestion, we paid the slight upcharge to get the cinnamon raisin toast instead of white or wheat and it was worth every penny.  Homemade, full of plump raisins and lots of cinnamon sugar, it was heaven on a plate.  I also had what may have been the best biscuits of my life.  I ordered biscuits and gravy and while the gravy was delicious, I think the biscuits were so good they would have been fine all by themselves.  They were so buttery and really thick and dense, but somehow not too heavy.  I had a side of hash browns and they were fine. They were thickly shredded and well browned, but unseasoned.  A dash of salt and ketchup and they got the job done.  Our server was not unfriendly, but she did just enough.  We laughed when we asked for more napkins and she brought back one.  We are a spilling, sloppy family and had already cleaned up one mess.  So back she went for more napkins.  :-)  

The atmosphere is not upscale, but nicer than your average diner.  Our daughter loved hunting for all the roosters in the decor.  We found them on the walls, on a clock, on the bathroom doors, and even as purse hooks inside the bathroom stalls.  

Yum...I cannot wait to get back there and have another biscuit!","Text1: Breakfast was swing and a miss for me.

1,"Another sports bar!  I suppose we have a lot of them in these parts.  Corner Bar is a pretty run-of-the-mill type of operation.  I haven't ever had their food, though I'm guessing it's relatively standard bar food and thus nothing special.  You can get just about any domestic your heart desires for the prices you'd expect.

The patio (as both Robin and Sharon have noted) is nice.  In fact, it's probably my favorite feature of this establishment.  Corner Bar's location is pretty prime, but I just find it nearly impossible to opt for the CB over the Gold Rush right across the street.  It's just more my vibe (i.e. not overtly a sports bar).

If I was still a sports nut (mind you, it's been about eight years since I've watched any sport regularly), this would probably be in my top three bars.  Seems like a decent spot to congregate with the buds to watch a Predators game or something.  If you enjoy sports bars, average-priced domestics, and an absolutely normal vibe, this could be your spot.","Another stop in the desperately hip district of Edgehill.  Much like the other places of business in the area, Edgehill Studios pushes its post-modern architecture and ultra-trendy atmosphere on its customers.  However, because the sandwiches are affordable and because it's so conducive to laptopers, I had to give the place a star more than my gut wanted me to.

They make a decent cup of coffee, and prices and selection are similar to places like Portland Brew and Bongo Java.  Apparently they don't serve soup through the summer (a bit of a bummer since I am a year round soup junkie), but their selection is fairly diverse for such a small cafe.

Edgehill Studios Cafe has more room than I expected, and it typically isn't too busy, so it's an alright spot to duck in and do some web surfing.  The staff is quick and friendly, and it's usually pretty quiet.  I haven't visited the actual studio or been on an evening with live music, but I imagine it is pretty par for a coffee shop/venue.  I deem Edgehill Cafe worthy of your business, but I just can't quite make it a regular stop.  I'll stick to Portland Brew.","Text1: Another sports bar!

0,"Maybe it's because I am a frequent diner of Korean cuisine, but all this place seemed like to me was overpriced Korean fusion food in a ""hip"" setting. Honestly, if you don't eat Korean food EVER then this place will be AMAZING to you. The place is clean and sleek, the chicken wings are bomb, and bibimbap is not an item that is easily accessible in center city. But if you are like me and regularly eat Korean food, $2 per wing, $3 for fermented cabbage that usually comes free, and ~$15 for a bowl of rice and veggies in a stone bowl are just not worth it.
On the plus side, at least this place is helping Korean food become more mainstream.","the staff is incredibly attentive.. almost ninja like.. I'd be drinking my water.. and put the glass down.. almost immediately it was refilled.. like out of the blue.. They were just very nice..

The tableside guac was delish.. I love how you can decide how much of certain items or if at all would be put... fresh guacamole holds a special place in my heart, especially when accompanied by house made chips. 

I also ordered the fundido.. it was delicious.. very flavorful.. 
My friend got the sopa azteca, and the chicken and rice she liked the soup, although she did complain that because the cheese was cubed, she couldn't taste it in every bite. Despite that she enjoyed it. She ordered the chicken and rice and really enjoyed everything except the lime mayo.. 

With such fresh ingredients, it's hard to go wrong.","Text1: Maybe it's because I am a frequent diner of Korean cuisine, but all this place seemed like to me was overpriced Korean fusion food in a ""hip"" setting.

0,"We decided to check out The Good Pie after our friend from Italy gave it high praise.  The place is located Downtown on Olive and the area there is really developing so it's a great spot.

The inside is very welcoming and casual....lots of brick and wood and decorated with vintage bicycles.   This is not a large place but there were plenty of tables and even a nice patio outside where we noticed that they were growing fresh vegetables and herbs.

Our waitress seemed a little new but was very nice.  We ordered 2 pizzas and a starter of an olive sampler (yum!!)
The pizzas were The Good Pie and the Mushroom.  The crust is made there in their oven and is thin but soft and airy.  
The Good Pie was our favorite since we LOVE the sauce....and the mushrooms were heaven on the other one but there wasn't any sauce, only cheese....so maybe next time we'll combine them if that's allowed.

Everything was wonderful and we'll definitely be back!  I'll post photos later tonight.","So much to do out doors here! You can see horses that are kept across the small street, play in the fun park, get wet in the new little water area, grill out, picnic, or sit by the Bay and look out over the water. There is also Fishing available to rent poles very cheap like $5 and they have bait! Plus there's a small local restaurant at the pier that has everything from seafood and cold drinks to yummy ice cream. This is a great place to walk with friends and family or exercise even.

We bought the holy crap expensive tickets to Living with Dinosaurs because of how cool the show sounded, and how that building fit life size muppets of dinosaurs in there is still beyond me. They weren't muppets, but you get my drift. 

It's situated downtown, so you can show up early and walk around before you head in for your show.

You're still going to have a bit of a wait depending on the flow you come in to, but chances are you won't be waiting long.

Bright, homey decor and even the bathrooms feel clean and light.  Owner is very nice and has gorgeous eyes.  (Waiter was pretty hot, too.)

My good (lacto-ovo-vegetarian) friend and I had a delicious lunch there today.  I have 2 yummy glasses of the Lemonada (1/2 mint iced tea mixed with 1/2 lemonade - the PERFECT summer refresher.  My friend had Greek Coffee - made the traditional way.

For our lunch he had Shouksouka (delicious) - great for a breakfast or brunch, too.  Very rich and filling.  I had the Kanella platter and for $12 it was the perfect way to sample alot of offerings.  For me the best part were the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  Now, I realize that everybody and everybody's grandma makes 'em dirrefently and Kanella's are distinctively sweet with currants and luscious Pine Nuts.  The falafel, Zucchinni fritter and yogurt were all good too.  The only thing I could not eat was the spicy tomato salad (next time I will order it made mild - if they can do that).  It was soooooo peppery with a ""harrissa-like"" taste to it.

Baklava was served with syrupy orange slices and was chock-full-o-nuts.  Very good for $3.50!

I've been a member here for about a year and there were plenty of classes to keep me busy and lots of equipment so that I didn't have to wait to do the exercises that I wanted to do.  I'm sad that I'm leaving it because I've recently moved.  It is really nice and yes it is expensive but you got a lot with that membership.

They recently completed a complete overhaul to the men's showers which is cool.  It's not that they were bad before but I can see how they needed the upgrade.

I did spinning classes, boxing, circuit classes, pilates, swimming and general weight training.  I even tried yoga a couple of times which was awesome because it was in a private yoga studio, not a room with the lights dim.  The yoga studio was tranquil and even though I ended up hurting myself, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't think I'm the yoga type.

The website went a bit wonky from time to time when I tried to look at class schedules.  That's a minor complaint in my book.  I was able to take advantage of a special offer when I joined so I beat the initiation fee which is outrageous by the way.  Still, they offer specials and will let you train for a few days to see what you think of it.

I really liked working out here and I hope that a gym near my new place will be even half as good as the bellevue.  If it's convenient and you want to pay for it, you will enjoy it.","Xochitl has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. A Groupon and a special occasion finally led me to dinner there recently.

I don't like to give 5 star reviews after just one visit, however I honestly can't think of a reason not to. The food was fabulous as was the service, drinks and atmosphere. There's no reason they don't deserve this 5.

My husband and I arrived a little before our reservation to check out happy hour. We sat at the bar and were able to enjoy a few of their delicious margaritas. They don't use mixes and you can taste the fresh squeezed lime. They were strong, but you couldn't tell. 

So we got the Groupon deal that others have mentioned. It includes a shared guacamole, shared flatbread, choice of two entrees and shared dessert. They were so very kind as to let us do a little menu modification. Rather than the shared flatbread, we opted for our own guacamoles, which excited me since I could try it with ingredients my husband doesn't like.

Wait, ingredients in guacamole? Yep, you get to customize it. I opted for Spanish onion, raw garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, crab and goat cheese. It was heavenly! It was so creamy, and it had the perfect balance between tasting the individual ingredients and being well blended. The chips were light and crispy with a nice amount of saltiness. 

For our entrees, my husband and I decided to share the braised short rib and Pollo Fritto. I'm honestly not fan of ordering chicken out, but the Yelp reviews swayed us in the direction of the Pollo Fritto. Do yourself a flavor and get it. It was lightly fried chicken was very packed with flavor. The skin and meat were delectable. The short rib was also top notch and I would have been raving more about it, if the Pollo Fritto wasn't so darn good. Amazing, amazing, amazing. The sides were delicious as well. 

The meal came with a chocolate sponge cake soaked in triple chocolate cream with whipped cream and coco power. It was plated with a big ""X"" for Xochtil on it. Not only was the dessert good, but I enjoyed the presentation. A chocolate sponge cake could have looked so boring. 

The Groupon also comes with a wine pairing for each course except dessert. With the exception of the main course, you didn't get an option. For the main course you could choose between a Malbec or a Chardonnay. The wines were enjoyable and on point with each course. 

As I mentioned earlier, we also had top notch service. Our server was attentive, friendly, funny but not the least bit intrusive. 

Pro tip: you are allowed to buy this Groupon every 90 days.

Groupon or not, we will be back. Despite taking so long to actually try it in the first place, Xochtil has quickly found a place on my favorites list.","Text1: I'm gonna miss this place.

I've been a member here for about a year and there were plenty of classes to keep me busy and lots of equipment so that I didn't have to wait to do the exercises that I wanted to do.  I'm sad that I'm leaving it because I've recently moved.  It is really nice and yes it is expensive but you got a lot with that membership.

They recently completed a complete overhaul to the men's showers which is cool.  It's not that they were bad before but I can see how they needed the upgrade.

I did spinning classes, boxing, circuit classes, pilates, swimming and general weight training.  I even tried yoga a couple of times which was awesome because it was in a private yoga studio, not a room with the lights dim.  The yoga studio was tranquil and even though I ended up hurting myself, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't think I'm the yoga type.

The website went a bit wonky from time to time when I tried to look at class schedules.  That's a minor complaint in my book.  I was able to take advantage of a special offer when I joined so I beat the initiation fee which is outrageous by the way.  Still, they offer specials and will let you train for a few days to see what you think of it.

I really liked working out here and I hope that a gym near my new place will be even half as good as the bellevue.  If it's convenient and you want to pay for it, you will enjoy it. 

 Text2: Xochitl has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. A Groupon and a special occasion finally led me to dinner there recently.

I don't like to give 5 star reviews after just one visit, however I honestly can't think of a reason not to. The food was fabulous as was the service, drinks and atmosphere. There's no reason they don't deserve this 5.

My husband and I arrived a little before our reservation to check out happy hour. We sat at the bar and were able to enjoy a few of their delicious margaritas. They don't use mixes and you can taste the fresh squeezed lime. They were strong, but you couldn't tell. 

So we got the Groupon deal that others have mentioned. It includes a shared guacamole, shared flatbread, choice of two entrees and shared dessert. They were so very kind as to let us do a little menu modification. Rather than the shared flatbread, we opted for our own guacamoles, which excited me since I could try it with ingredients my husband doesn't like.

Wait, ingredients in guacamole? Yep, you get to customize it. I opted for Spanish onion, raw garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, crab and goat cheese. It was heavenly! It was so creamy, and it had the perfect balance between tasting the individual ingredients and being well blended. The chips were light and crispy with a nice amount of saltiness. 

For our entrees, my husband and I decided to share the braised short rib and Pollo Fritto. I'm honestly not fan of ordering chicken out, but the Yelp reviews swayed us in the direction of the Pollo Fritto. Do yourself a flavor and get it. It was lightly fried chicken was very packed with flavor. The skin and meat were delectable. The short rib was also top notch and I would have been raving more about it, if the Pollo Fritto wasn't so darn good. Amazing, amazing, amazing. The sides were delicious as well.

I had to up my review from a 4 star to 5 star.  We visited this location and I ordered the chili (as I usually do).  It tasted off and smelled weird.  I told the waitress that it didn't taste right and she took it away with no problem.

10 minutes later the manager comes over and tells me she is sorry about the chili and that she checked the batch and it was a bit over cooked/burnt. During the course of the day the chili temperature increased and burnt the chili. She thanked me and was really happy I told her .    I never expected that .. I just expected it to come off my bill.. Never that the manager would actually check the batch and act on me saying it tasted weird.  Bravo..  So glad we eat here a lot.  great place.","We come here for a quick bite to eat.

I can always get an appointment made when I call. They have always treated Charlie with great care and I love that they give me  notes on how everything went and what products they used.

The price is very affordable, for a wash and nails clipped it costs me only $27 and that includes brushing his hair, cleaning his ears and teeth and the regular wash and dry.

I don't think I would take Charlie anywhere else. Petsmart is close and convenient to me and the price is very easy on my wallet and the service is consistently good.","If you want a hoagie that is not laden with enough cholesteral to choke an ox, a Vietnamese hoagie from Cafe Huong Lan is worth a shot.  Good for veg-heads and carnivores alike, there are many different options, some of which Americans may find a little intimidating.  My usual was the vegetarian hoagie because it was so damn yummy.  With seasoned tofu, fresh cilantro, some sort of buttery mayo and jalapeno peppers on a very fresh French baguette, it is so deliciously light and perfect.  If you really want to reduce the fat, get it without the buttery stuff.  It's still good.  I'm also a big fan of their tapioca-like plantain pudding dealie.  I know that's not the proper terminology but that's pretty much what it is.  It's delicious.","Text1: Petsmart is my go to place to get Charles handsome!

0,"The Blue Duck describes itself as a relaxed tavern featuring classic and new American eats. OK, I can go with that. I stopped in on a Tuesday night to the new Maplewood location with my father and stepmother. We got there right around six and we were the only table but after a couple of minutes it started filling up. Thank goodness because I have a thing about being the only table in a restaurant. I never want to eat somewhere that no one else wants to eat but we were OK here. Our server was friendly and pleasant but not that well versed on the menu. My father was asking about the Chow Chow side and she was trying to describe the flavor to him and I blurted out that it's pickled vegetables and she said oh yes, pickled is correct, they're pickled. So we ordered the Falafel Balls (harrissa tahini, smoked green tomato jam, cilantro, grilled flatbread) appetizer for the table. The grind of the chickpeas was too fine and the falafel had little flavor. The pita bread had a nice char but was very thick and cut in tiny triangles. The harrissa tahini turned out to be incredibly spicy and we are a family that likes heat. My father ate so much of the sauce he was sucking on ice cubes to relieve the heat. He was worried he wasn't going to be able to eat his entree. He ordered the DLT, a duck sandwich, and subbed the side for a small salad. The salad was tiny and no big deal but the sandwich he really liked. He commented on how moist and flavorful the duck was. My stepmother ordered the Seared Trout. This dish was beautifully presented and quite good. There was a tower of fried brussels sprouts on top and a squash puree under the fish. It was all excellent. As soon as I read the Pastrami and Pimiento sandwich I knew I had to order that. I love pastrami and I love pimiento cheese. I got the Mac N Cheese side which was just fair. The sandwich was delicious. I was only able to eat half of it. It was messy but good. I'd order it again and again. They ordered the cookie plate for dessert but I couldn't eat any. I was too full. The macarons looked delicious. Maybe next time.","Ok, aYUP it is ok.

We have been a few times now.

Friendly folks, but know nothing of service. No matter what we have ever had to drink a refill was never offered.... well not quite true, we were offered a refill as we were paying the bill today. I had coffee and water, the coffee should be advertised as the slowest drip coffee in the west, and apparently only one cup was brewed. Water too must be in short supply. Also iced tea ordered by the others ran dry and they do not bring a large glass full to begin with. 

The food is good, thus being ok. Last time we got tacos there was a salad on the plate, today nothing but the tacos. They had a nice flavour but not quite as robust as before.  The other food was fine in its flavour. 

We sat outside today, man what a depressing setting. That place needs some imagination and care to make it a pleasant experience. The inside of the building is small but pleasant enough. 

I hope this place does well but it truly needs to step up its game in service and consistency of food.

As those who follow my reviews, know I am a big fan of Fried Green Tomatoes. So when I saw them on the menu as an appetizer, I couldn't resist. Their green tomatoes were almost like a salad with the additional mixed greens and strips of bacon. The coating around the tomatoes was thick and crispy, but still giving you the great taste of fresh green tomato. If dining at lunch time, it could almost be a meal itself. 

My entree was the Pork Chop, which was thick, tender and juicy. It was served in a hot cast iron skillet with sautéed vegetables. I love the other white meat and The Block always serves it up well. 

I saved room for dessert, so I was excited to try their Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée. It was a sweet treat.  If creme brûlée is on the menu, I order it and The Block, did it well. I'm always amazed at the crisp top on a brûlée and how creamy it is beneath. The vanilla flavor of this one, was strong which is fine with me, since vanilla is my favorite flavor.

A special touch that I like here at The Block is the way they serve salt & pepper. They don't use the typical shakers, they have small ramekins with tiny spoons. I've never had to use them, my food has always been seasoned well, but I like the unique presentation. 

I'll be returning soon to try their burger for lunch. Plus, I want more Brussels Sprouts, since I didn't enjoy an order this visit.

(For those who turn their nose up at scrapple: yes, there is a difference in scrapple quality. See Kraftwork for the high end of the scrapple spectrum.)

Aside from the scrapple, everything else was just fine here.  The breakfast special was very reasonably priced.  But some loud regulars who seemed to think that everyone else wanted to hear about their exciting lives were rather annoying. 

 Text2: Brianna, Kelley Joan-na and all of the girls at the desk were awesome!! Great customer service and Brianna not only handled the front desk but she made food items in the Bistro, she is surely multi-talented! The room was quiet had a small porch for fresh air... I like the fact that they have a full bar in the hotel-lobby sitting areas up to date  with flat-screens and if you want anything to drink.cool! I will be back....JD",no
